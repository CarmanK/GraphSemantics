Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO.

Using sequential truncation and site directed mutagenesis of CYP3A4 proximal promoter with DEC1 construct, we showed that DEC1 specifically bound to CCCTGC sequence in the proximal promoter of CYP3A4, which was validated by EMSA and ChIP assay. These findings suggest that the repression of CYP3A4 by IL-6 is achieved through increasing the DEC1 expression in human hepatocytes, the increased DEC1 binds to the CCCTGC sequence in the promoter of CYP3A4 to form CCCTGC-DEC1 complex, and the complex downregulates the CYP3A4 expression and its enzymatic activity"}, {"phrase": "ATCC enzymatic", "id": "1505", "article": "Cortical-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratios were assessed using [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET).

Here, we have evaluated commonly used microscopic, microbiologic and biochemical methods to quantify bacterial biofilms, in order to clarify their comparability and applicability. Two bacterial species frequently involved in biofilm-associated infections, Staphylococcus aureus and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were used as model organisms; their initial adhesion and biofilm formation on titanium and on antibacterial copper were analyzed using the following methods: LIVE/DEAD fluorescence staining and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, ultrasonic or a newly developed enzymatic detachment followed by standard plate counting (CFU method), a resazurin-based assay, the BacTiter-Glo\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 assay and crystal violet staining.

A recent study showed that secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) may be a potential binding target of maslinic acid. The human group IIA (hGIIA)-sPLA2 is found in human sera and their levels are correlated with severity of inflammation. This study aims to determine whether maslinic acid interacts with hGIIA-sPLA2 and inhibits inflammatory response induced by this enzyme. It is shown that maslinic acid enhanced intrinsic fluorescence of hGIIA-sPLA2 and inhibited its enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Molecular docking revealed that maslinic acid binds to calcium binding and interfacial phospholipid binding site, suggesting that it inhibit access of catalytic calcium ion for enzymatic reaction and block binding of the enzyme to membrane phospholipid. The hGIIA-sPLA2 enzyme is also responsible in mediating monocyte recruitment and differentiation. Results showed that maslinic acid inhibit hGIIA-sPLA2-induced THP-1 cell differentiation and migration, and the effect observed is specific to hGIIA-sPLA2 as cells treated with maslinic acid alone did not significantly affect the number of adherent and migrated cells. Considering that hGIIA-sPLA2 enzyme is known to hydrolyze glyceroacylphospholipids present in lipoproteins and cell membranes, maslinic acid may bind and inhibit hGIIA-sPLA2 enzymatic activity, thereby reduces the release of fatty acids and lysophospholipids which stimulates monocyte migration and differentiation.

Furthermore, the characteristics of the nutrient contamination differed depending on the agricultural land use pattern in the suburban areas: high nitrate contamination was observed in Jakarta (dry fields), and relatively lower nutrients consisting mainly of ammonium were detected in Bangkok (paddy fields). The exponential increase in NO3--delta15N along with the NO3- reduction and clear delta18O/delta15N slopes of NO3- (approximately 0.5) indicated the occurrence of denitrification. An anoxic subsurface system associated with the natural geological setting (e.g., the old tidal plain at Bangkok) and artificial pavement coverage served to buffer NO3- contamination via active denitrification and reduced nitrification. Our results showed that NO3- and NH4+ contamination of the aquifers in Metro Manila, Bangkok, and Jakarta was not excessive, suggesting low risk of drinking groundwater to human health, at present.

Furthermore, the characteristics of the nutrient contamination differed depending on the agricultural land use pattern in the suburban areas: high nitrate contamination was observed in Jakarta (dry fields), and relatively lower nutrients consisting mainly of ammonium were detected in Bangkok (paddy fields). The exponential increase in NO3--delta15N along with the NO3- reduction and clear delta18O/delta15N slopes of NO3- (approximately 0.5) indicated the occurrence of denitrification.

Analysis of the cytotoxicity of all the peptide conjugates showed that: (i) the position of the ligand influenced the IC50 values, (ii) the incorporation of the \u00ce\u00b2Ala-Lys dipeptide rendered non active sequences, (iii) peptide conjugates derived from the (S,S')-BPBP ligand were more active than those bearing (Me2)PyTACN, and (iv) the introduction of the cleavable tetrapeptide significantly enhanced the activity of the BPBP conjugates (IC50 of 4.3 to 11.7 \u00ce\u00bcM ( and ) compared to 26.0 to >50 \u00ce\u00bcM (, and )). The most active peptide was BPBP-GFLG-BP16 () (IC50 of 4.3 to 5.0 \u00ce\u00bcM). This high activity was attributed to its high internalization in MCF-7 cells, as shown by flow cytometry, and to the subsequent release of the ligand by the intracellular cleavage of the enzyme-labile spacer, as observed in cathepsin B enzymatic assays.

A recent study showed that secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) may be a potential binding target of maslinic acid. The human group IIA (hGIIA)-sPLA2 is found in human sera and their levels are correlated with severity of inflammation. This study aims to determine whether maslinic acid interacts with hGIIA-sPLA2 and inhibits inflammatory response induced by this enzyme. It is shown that maslinic acid enhanced intrinsic fluorescence of hGIIA-sPLA2 and inhibited its enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Molecular docking revealed that maslinic acid binds to calcium binding and interfacial phospholipid binding site, suggesting that it inhibit access of catalytic calcium ion for enzymatic reaction and block binding of the enzyme to membrane phospholipid. The hGIIA-sPLA2 enzyme is also responsible in mediating monocyte recruitment and differentiation. Results showed that maslinic acid inhibit hGIIA-sPLA2-induced THP-1 cell differentiation and migration, and the effect observed is specific to hGIIA-sPLA2 as cells treated with maslinic acid alone did not significantly affect the number of adherent and migrated cells. Considering that hGIIA-sPLA2 enzyme is known to hydrolyze glyceroacylphospholipids present in lipoproteins and cell membranes, maslinic acid may bind and inhibit hGIIA-sPLA2 enzymatic activity, thereby reduces the release of fatty acids and lysophospholipids which stimulates monocyte migration and differentiation.

Although often very effective in hampering microbial adhesion, natural epitopes often show limited resistance to enzymatic degradation. The use of carbohydrate mimics (glycomimetics) as a replacement for natural sugars potentially allows higher metabolic stability and also higher selectivity towards the desired protein target.
