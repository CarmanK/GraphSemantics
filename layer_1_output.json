The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide.

Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

The effect of DA was concentration-dependent and was mimicked by the dopaminergic D1-like receptor agonist SKF-38393 but not by the D2-like receptor agonist bromocriptine. The D1-like antagonist SCH-23390 shifted to the right the concentration-response curves of both DA and SKF-38393, while neither the D2-like antagonist domperidone, nor the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol affected to any significant extent the inhibitory effect of DA.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

However, these recommendations are largely based on observational data. The aim of this systematic review (SR) was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in brain-dead potential organ donors. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from the earliest accessible date up to March 2013 with a qualified librarian. Studies comparing the effects of any corticosteroid with those of placebo, standard treatment, or another active comparator were sought. Two independent reviewers evaluated each citation retrieved and selected studies independently and in duplicate. A third independent reviewer resolved any disagreement. Outcomes included donor haemodynamics and oxygenation, organ procurement, recipient survival, and graft survival. This review included 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. The majority used methylprednisolone and often combined it with other hormonal therapies. Ten out of the 11 RCTs yielded neutral results. However, in observational studies, use of corticosteroids generally resulted in improved donor haemodynamics and oxygenation status, increased organ procurement, and improved recipient and graft survival. Overall quality of included studies was poor, as most of them presented high risks of confounding. This SR highlights the low quality and conflicting evidence supporting the routine use of corticosteroids in the management of organ donors.

Exposure of MM6 cells, which do not express CD36 or other scavenger receptors, to such enzymatically modified LDL (enzLDL) resulted in upregulation of CD36 surface protein and mRNA expression. Similar effects were observed with free 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid but not its esterified counterpart. Less pronounced effects were observed with LDL modified by 15LO alone.

Importantly, LDL modified by sPLA2 and 15LO did not efficiently induce upregulation CD36 in PPARgamma-deficient macrophage-differentiated embryonic stem cells confirming a role of PPARgamma in CD36 expression in cells stimulated with enzLDL.

With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism. Potency of those compounds that promote the transition varies widely with bromfenac being the most potent and nepafenac having almost no effect.

Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

However, over time, while the overall size of the CDs does not change, aromatic domains form and grow, resulting in a second, faster decay channel at similar wavelengths and also creating additional lower energetic states. Electrophoresis provides further evidence that the ensemble of CDs consists of several subsets with different internal structure and surface charge.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

A stronger impact of residue 3 confirmed previous findings on its more dominant role in metal coordination. In vitro studies on the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line, MEF mice embryonic fibroblasts, and MEF with the knocked-out Atox1 gene (Atox1-/-) consistently identified C3U/C6U as the most potent inhibitor of ROS cellular production based on the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (H2DCF-DA) assay, also in comparison with known drugs employed in the clinic for Wilson's disease.

This review included 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. The majority used methylprednisolone and often combined it with other hormonal therapies.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from the earliest accessible date up to March 2013 with a qualified librarian. Studies comparing the effects of any corticosteroid with those of placebo, standard treatment, or another active comparator were sought. Two independent reviewers evaluated each citation retrieved and selected studies independently and in duplicate. A third independent reviewer resolved any disagreement. Outcomes included donor haemodynamics and oxygenation, organ procurement, recipient survival, and graft survival. This review included 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. The majority used methylprednisolone and often combined it with other hormonal therapies. Ten out of the 11 RCTs yielded neutral results. However, in observational studies, use of corticosteroids generally resulted in improved donor haemodynamics and oxygenation status, increased organ procurement, and improved recipient and graft survival. Overall quality of included studies was poor, as most of them presented high risks of confounding.

Exposure of MM6 cells, which do not express CD36 or other scavenger receptors, to such enzymatically modified LDL (enzLDL) resulted in upregulation of CD36 surface protein and mRNA expression. Similar effects were observed with free 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid but not its esterified counterpart. Less pronounced effects were observed with LDL modified by 15LO alone.

With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism. Potency of those compounds that promote the transition varies widely with bromfenac being the most potent and nepafenac having almost no effect.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from the earliest accessible date up to March 2013 with a qualified librarian. Studies comparing the effects of any corticosteroid with those of placebo, standard treatment, or another active comparator were sought. Two independent reviewers evaluated each citation retrieved and selected studies independently and in duplicate. A third independent reviewer resolved any disagreement. Outcomes included donor haemodynamics and oxygenation, organ procurement, recipient survival, and graft survival. This review included 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. The majority used methylprednisolone and often combined it with other hormonal therapies. Ten out of the 11 RCTs yielded neutral results. However, in observational studies, use of corticosteroids generally resulted in improved donor haemodynamics and oxygenation status, increased organ procurement, and improved recipient and graft survival. Overall quality of included studies was poor, as most of them presented high risks of confounding.

Exposure of MM6 cells, which do not express CD36 or other scavenger receptors, to such enzymatically modified LDL (enzLDL) resulted in upregulation of CD36 surface protein and mRNA expression.

With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism. Potency of those compounds that promote the transition varies widely with bromfenac being the most potent and nepafenac having almost no effect.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

The effect of DA was concentration-dependent and was mimicked by the dopaminergic D1-like receptor agonist SKF-38393 but not by the D2-like receptor agonist bromocriptine. The D1-like antagonist SCH-23390 shifted to the right the concentration-response curves of both DA and SKF-38393, while neither the D2-like antagonist domperidone, nor the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol affected to any significant extent the inhibitory effect of DA. SKF-38393 also significantly reduced TPA-induced increase of intracellular CA, an effect which was antagonized by SCH-23390.

However, it remains an unresolved issue whether beat-to-beat alternations in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i ) or AP morphology are the primary cause of pro-arrhythmic alternans. Here we show that in atria AP alternans occurs secondary to CaT alternans. CaT alternans leads to complex beat-to-beat changes in Ca(2+)-regulated ion currents that determine alternans of AP morphology. We report the novel finding that alternans of AP morphology is largely sustained by the activity of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs). Suppression of the CaCCs significantly reduces AP alternans, while CaT alternans remains unaffected. The demonstration of a major role of CaCCs in the development of AP alternans opens new possibilities for atrial alternans and arrhythmia prevention. Cardiac alternans, described as periodic beat-to-beat alternations in contraction, action potential (AP) morphology or cytosolic Ca transient (CaT) amplitude, is a high risk indicator for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We investigated mechanisms of cardiac alternans in single rabbit atrial myocytes. CaTs were monitored simultaneously with membrane currents or APs recorded with the patch clamp technique. Beat-to-beat alternations of AP morphology and CaT amplitude revealed a strong quantitative correlation. Application of voltage clamp protocols in the form of pre-recorded APs (AP-clamp) during pacing-induced CaT alternans revealed a Ca(2+)-dependent current consisting of a large outward component (4.78 \u00c2\u00b1 0.58 pA pF(-1) in amplitude) coinciding with AP phases 1 and 2 that was followed by an inward current (-0.42 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03 pA pF(-1); n = 21) during AP repolarization. Approximately 90% of the initial outward current was blocked by substitution of Cl(-) ions or application of the Cl(-) channel blocker DIDS identifying it as a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (ICaCC). The prominent AP prolongation at action potential duration at 30% repolarization level during the small alternans CaT was due to reduced ICaCC. Inhibition of Cl(-) currents abolished AP alternans, but failed to affect CaT alternans, indicating that disturbances in Ca(2+) signalling were the primary event leading to alternans, and ICaCC played a decisive role in shaping the beat-to-beat alternations in AP morphology observed during alternans"}, {"phrase": "sulfite Ca", "id": "9254", "article": "We investigated the effects of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on swelling related properties of mitochondria, with an emphasis on compounds that are marketed and utilized topically in the eye (nepafenac, ketorolac, diclofenac, bromfenac), and compared these to the effects of amfenac (a metabolite of nepafenac) and to celecoxib (active principle of Celebrex). With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism.

The value of the excited state magnetic moment estimated from the A term is very low compared with those of monomeric porphyrins, which confirms the nonaromatic character of the cyclic array and the lack of a global ring current in the ground state of the neutral nanoring.

A chamber oxidation technique using high, sustained OH radical concentrations was used to simulate long reaction times in the atmosphere. This aging technique leads to higher yields than in previously reported chamber experiments. Yields were highest for cyclic and polycyclic precursors, though yield exhibited little dependence on number of rings. However, the oxygen-to-carbon ratio of the SOA was highest for the polycyclic precursors. These trends are consistent with aerosol formation requiring two generations of oxidation and 3-4 oxygen-containing functional groups in order to condense. Cyclic, unbranched structures are protected from fragmentation during the first oxidation step, with C-C bond scission instead leading to ring opening, efficient functionalization, and high SOA yields. Fragmentation may occur during subsequent oxidation steps, limiting yields by forming volatile products. Polycyclic structures can undergo multiple ring opening reactions, but do not have markedly higher yields, likely due to enhanced fragmentation in the second oxidation step.

Therefore, there is a major effort to target PPIs in basic research and in the pharmaceutical industry. Protein-protein interfaces are usually large, flat, and often lack pockets, complicating the discovery of small molecules that target such sites. Alternative targeting approaches using antibodies have limitations due to poor oral bioavailability, low cell-permeability, and production inefficiency. Using peptides to target PPI interfaces has several advantages. Peptides have higher conformational flexibility, increased selectivity, and are generally inexpensive. However, peptides have their own limitations including poor stability and inefficiency crossing cell membranes. To overcome such limitations, peptide cyclization can be performed. Cyclization has been demonstrated to improve peptide selectivity, metabolic stability, and bioavailability. However, predicting the bioactive conformation of a cyclic peptide is not trivial. To overcome this challenge, one attractive approach it to screen a focused library to screen in which all backbone cyclic peptides have the same primary sequence, but differ in parameters that influence their conformation, such as ring size and position. We describe a detailed protocol for synthesizing a library of backbone cyclic peptides targeting specific parasite PPIs.

We discuss the principles of electrically driven fermentations and how EF can be used to steer both pure culture and microbiota-based fermentations.

The effect of DA was concentration-dependent and was mimicked by the dopaminergic D1-like receptor agonist SKF-38393 but not by the D2-like receptor agonist bromocriptine. The D1-like antagonist SCH-23390 shifted to the right the concentration-response curves of both DA and SKF-38393, while neither the D2-like antagonist domperidone, nor the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol affected to any significant extent the inhibitory effect of DA.

Phosphorylation of ERK, Akt and p38 MAPK, but not JNK, was increased by baicalein, and inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK, but not that of Akt or p38 MAPK, blocked the baicalein-induced increase in K1/K10 expression, suggesting that ERK activation is involved in this increase. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or blockade of Ca(2+) influx by pharmacological inhibition or silencing of the TRPV4 receptor did not affect growth arrest, ROS generation or apoptosis, but inhibited baicalein-induced ERK phosphorylation and K1/K10 expression. Thus, baicalein treatment increases differentiation, and decreases proliferation, of keratinocytes.

However, it remains an unresolved issue whether beat-to-beat alternations in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i ) or AP morphology are the primary cause of pro-arrhythmic alternans. Here we show that in atria AP alternans occurs secondary to CaT alternans. CaT alternans leads to complex beat-to-beat changes in Ca(2+)-regulated ion currents that determine alternans of AP morphology. We report the novel finding that alternans of AP morphology is largely sustained by the activity of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs). Suppression of the CaCCs significantly reduces AP alternans, while CaT alternans remains unaffected. The demonstration of a major role of CaCCs in the development of AP alternans opens new possibilities for atrial alternans and arrhythmia prevention. Cardiac alternans, described as periodic beat-to-beat alternations in contraction, action potential (AP) morphology or cytosolic Ca transient (CaT) amplitude, is a high risk indicator for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We investigated mechanisms of cardiac alternans in single rabbit atrial myocytes. CaTs were monitored simultaneously with membrane currents or APs recorded with the patch clamp technique. Beat-to-beat alternations of AP morphology and CaT amplitude revealed a strong quantitative correlation. Application of voltage clamp protocols in the form of pre-recorded APs (AP-clamp) during pacing-induced CaT alternans revealed a Ca(2+)-dependent current consisting of a large outward component (4.78 \u00c2\u00b1 0.58 pA pF(-1) in amplitude) coinciding with AP phases 1 and 2 that was followed by an inward current (-0.42 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03 pA pF(-1); n = 21) during AP repolarization. Approximately 90% of the initial outward current was blocked by substitution of Cl(-) ions or application of the Cl(-) channel blocker DIDS identifying it as a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (ICaCC). The prominent AP prolongation at action potential duration at 30% repolarization level during the small alternans CaT was due to reduced ICaCC. Inhibition of Cl(-) currents abolished AP alternans, but failed to affect CaT alternans, indicating that disturbances in Ca(2+) signalling were the primary event leading to alternans, and ICaCC played a decisive role in shaping the beat-to-beat alternations in AP morphology observed during alternans"}, {"phrase": "Ca Cu", "id": "9254", "article": "We investigated the effects of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on swelling related properties of mitochondria, with an emphasis on compounds that are marketed and utilized topically in the eye (nepafenac, ketorolac, diclofenac, bromfenac), and compared these to the effects of amfenac (a metabolite of nepafenac) and to celecoxib (active principle of Celebrex). With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism.

Since CA themselves are major mediators of the neural input to the immune system, we have examined their ability to affect PKC-induced TH mRNA expression and CA production in human isolated PBMC. In T- and B-lymphocytes (but not in monocytes) the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (but not its inactive analogue 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate) induced TH mRNA expression which was followed by an increase in the amount of intracellular CA.

However, it remains an unresolved issue whether beat-to-beat alternations in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i ) or AP morphology are the primary cause of pro-arrhythmic alternans. Here we show that in atria AP alternans occurs secondary to CaT alternans. CaT alternans leads to complex beat-to-beat changes in Ca(2+)-regulated ion currents that determine alternans of AP morphology. We report the novel finding that alternans of AP morphology is largely sustained by the activity of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs). Suppression of the CaCCs significantly reduces AP alternans, while CaT alternans remains unaffected. The demonstration of a major role of CaCCs in the development of AP alternans opens new possibilities for atrial alternans and arrhythmia prevention. Cardiac alternans, described as periodic beat-to-beat alternations in contraction, action potential (AP) morphology or cytosolic Ca transient (CaT) amplitude, is a high risk indicator for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We investigated mechanisms of cardiac alternans in single rabbit atrial myocytes. CaTs were monitored simultaneously with membrane currents or APs recorded with the patch clamp technique. Beat-to-beat alternations of AP morphology and CaT amplitude revealed a strong quantitative correlation. Application of voltage clamp protocols in the form of pre-recorded APs (AP-clamp) during pacing-induced CaT alternans revealed a Ca(2+)-dependent current consisting of a large outward component (4.78 \u00c2\u00b1 0.58 pA pF(-1) in amplitude) coinciding with AP phases 1 and 2 that was followed by an inward current (-0.42 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03 pA pF(-1); n = 21) during AP repolarization. Approximately 90% of the initial outward current was blocked by substitution of Cl(-) ions or application of the Cl(-) channel blocker DIDS identifying it as a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (ICaCC). The prominent AP prolongation at action potential duration at 30% repolarization level during the small alternans CaT was due to reduced ICaCC. Inhibition of Cl(-) currents abolished AP alternans, but failed to affect CaT alternans, indicating that disturbances in Ca(2+) signalling were the primary event leading to alternans, and ICaCC played a decisive role in shaping the beat-to-beat alternations in AP morphology observed during alternans"}, {"phrase": "Ca aromatic ring", "id": "14544", "article": "Persistent postherniotomy pain is located around the scar and external inguinal ring and is often described as deep rather than cutaneous, with frequent complaints of pain in adjacent areas.

With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism.

However, it remains an unresolved issue whether beat-to-beat alternations in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i ) or AP morphology are the primary cause of pro-arrhythmic alternans. Here we show that in atria AP alternans occurs secondary to CaT alternans. CaT alternans leads to complex beat-to-beat changes in Ca(2+)-regulated ion currents that determine alternans of AP morphology. We report the novel finding that alternans of AP morphology is largely sustained by the activity of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs). Suppression of the CaCCs significantly reduces AP alternans, while CaT alternans remains unaffected. The demonstration of a major role of CaCCs in the development of AP alternans opens new possibilities for atrial alternans and arrhythmia prevention. Cardiac alternans, described as periodic beat-to-beat alternations in contraction, action potential (AP) morphology or cytosolic Ca transient (CaT) amplitude, is a high risk indicator for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We investigated mechanisms of cardiac alternans in single rabbit atrial myocytes. CaTs were monitored simultaneously with membrane currents or APs recorded with the patch clamp technique. Beat-to-beat alternations of AP morphology and CaT amplitude revealed a strong quantitative correlation. Application of voltage clamp protocols in the form of pre-recorded APs (AP-clamp) during pacing-induced CaT alternans revealed a Ca(2+)-dependent current consisting of a large outward component (4.78 \u00c2\u00b1 0.58 pA pF(-1) in amplitude) coinciding with AP phases 1 and 2 that was followed by an inward current (-0.42 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03 pA pF(-1); n = 21) during AP repolarization. Approximately 90% of the initial outward current was blocked by substitution of Cl(-) ions or application of the Cl(-) channel blocker DIDS identifying it as a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (ICaCC). The prominent AP prolongation at action potential duration at 30% repolarization level during the small alternans CaT was due to reduced ICaCC. Inhibition of Cl(-) currents abolished AP alternans, but failed to affect CaT alternans, indicating that disturbances in Ca(2+) signalling were the primary event leading to alternans, and ICaCC played a decisive role in shaping the beat-to-beat alternations in AP morphology observed during alternans"}, {"phrase": "Ca copper", "id": "9254", "article": "We investigated the effects of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on swelling related properties of mitochondria, with an emphasis on compounds that are marketed and utilized topically in the eye (nepafenac, ketorolac, diclofenac, bromfenac), and compared these to the effects of amfenac (a metabolite of nepafenac) and to celecoxib (active principle of Celebrex). With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism.

However, it remains an unresolved issue whether beat-to-beat alternations in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i ) or AP morphology are the primary cause of pro-arrhythmic alternans. Here we show that in atria AP alternans occurs secondary to CaT alternans. CaT alternans leads to complex beat-to-beat changes in Ca(2+)-regulated ion currents that determine alternans of AP morphology. We report the novel finding that alternans of AP morphology is largely sustained by the activity of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs). Suppression of the CaCCs significantly reduces AP alternans, while CaT alternans remains unaffected. The demonstration of a major role of CaCCs in the development of AP alternans opens new possibilities for atrial alternans and arrhythmia prevention. Cardiac alternans, described as periodic beat-to-beat alternations in contraction, action potential (AP) morphology or cytosolic Ca transient (CaT) amplitude, is a high risk indicator for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We investigated mechanisms of cardiac alternans in single rabbit atrial myocytes. CaTs were monitored simultaneously with membrane currents or APs recorded with the patch clamp technique. Beat-to-beat alternations of AP morphology and CaT amplitude revealed a strong quantitative correlation. Application of voltage clamp protocols in the form of pre-recorded APs (AP-clamp) during pacing-induced CaT alternans revealed a Ca(2+)-dependent current consisting of a large outward component (4.78 \u00c2\u00b1 0.58 pA pF(-1) in amplitude) coinciding with AP phases 1 and 2 that was followed by an inward current (-0.42 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03 pA pF(-1); n = 21) during AP repolarization. Approximately 90% of the initial outward current was blocked by substitution of Cl(-) ions or application of the Cl(-) channel blocker DIDS identifying it as a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (ICaCC). The prominent AP prolongation at action potential duration at 30% repolarization level during the small alternans CaT was due to reduced ICaCC. Inhibition of Cl(-) currents abolished AP alternans, but failed to affect CaT alternans, indicating that disturbances in Ca(2+) signalling were the primary event leading to alternans, and ICaCC played a decisive role in shaping the beat-to-beat alternations in AP morphology observed during alternans"}, {"phrase": "Ca redox", "id": "9254", "article": "We investigated the effects of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on swelling related properties of mitochondria, with an emphasis on compounds that are marketed and utilized topically in the eye (nepafenac, ketorolac, diclofenac, bromfenac), and compared these to the effects of amfenac (a metabolite of nepafenac) and to celecoxib (active principle of Celebrex). With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism. Potency of those compounds that promote the transition varies widely with bromfenac being the most potent and nepafenac having almost no effect.

However, it remains an unresolved issue whether beat-to-beat alternations in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i ) or AP morphology are the primary cause of pro-arrhythmic alternans. Here we show that in atria AP alternans occurs secondary to CaT alternans. CaT alternans leads to complex beat-to-beat changes in Ca(2+)-regulated ion currents that determine alternans of AP morphology. We report the novel finding that alternans of AP morphology is largely sustained by the activity of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs). Suppression of the CaCCs significantly reduces AP alternans, while CaT alternans remains unaffected. The demonstration of a major role of CaCCs in the development of AP alternans opens new possibilities for atrial alternans and arrhythmia prevention. Cardiac alternans, described as periodic beat-to-beat alternations in contraction, action potential (AP) morphology or cytosolic Ca transient (CaT) amplitude, is a high risk indicator for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We investigated mechanisms of cardiac alternans in single rabbit atrial myocytes. CaTs were monitored simultaneously with membrane currents or APs recorded with the patch clamp technique. Beat-to-beat alternations of AP morphology and CaT amplitude revealed a strong quantitative correlation. Application of voltage clamp protocols in the form of pre-recorded APs (AP-clamp) during pacing-induced CaT alternans revealed a Ca(2+)-dependent current consisting of a large outward component (4.78 \u00c2\u00b1 0.58 pA pF(-1) in amplitude) coinciding with AP phases 1 and 2 that was followed by an inward current (-0.42 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03 pA pF(-1); n = 21) during AP repolarization. Approximately 90% of the initial outward current was blocked by substitution of Cl(-) ions or application of the Cl(-) channel blocker DIDS identifying it as a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (ICaCC). The prominent AP prolongation at action potential duration at 30% repolarization level during the small alternans CaT was due to reduced ICaCC. Inhibition of Cl(-) currents abolished AP alternans, but failed to affect CaT alternans, indicating that disturbances in Ca(2+) signalling were the primary event leading to alternans, and ICaCC played a decisive role in shaping the beat-to-beat alternations in AP morphology observed during alternans"}, {"phrase": "Ca ATCC", "id": "9254", "article": "We investigated the effects of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on swelling related properties of mitochondria, with an emphasis on compounds that are marketed and utilized topically in the eye (nepafenac, ketorolac, diclofenac, bromfenac), and compared these to the effects of amfenac (a metabolite of nepafenac) and to celecoxib (active principle of Celebrex). With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism. Potency of those compounds that promote the transition varies widely with bromfenac being the most potent and nepafenac having almost no effect.

SKF-38393 also significantly reduced TPA-induced increase of intracellular CA, an effect which was antagonized by SCH-23390. It is thus suggested that in human T- and B-lymphocytes PKC activation leads to TH mRNA expression and subsequent increase of intracellular CA, which can be inhibited by D1-like receptor activation.

However, it remains an unresolved issue whether beat-to-beat alternations in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i ) or AP morphology are the primary cause of pro-arrhythmic alternans. Here we show that in atria AP alternans occurs secondary to CaT alternans. CaT alternans leads to complex beat-to-beat changes in Ca(2+)-regulated ion currents that determine alternans of AP morphology. We report the novel finding that alternans of AP morphology is largely sustained by the activity of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs). Suppression of the CaCCs significantly reduces AP alternans, while CaT alternans remains unaffected. The demonstration of a major role of CaCCs in the development of AP alternans opens new possibilities for atrial alternans and arrhythmia prevention. Cardiac alternans, described as periodic beat-to-beat alternations in contraction, action potential (AP) morphology or cytosolic Ca transient (CaT) amplitude, is a high risk indicator for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We investigated mechanisms of cardiac alternans in single rabbit atrial myocytes. CaTs were monitored simultaneously with membrane currents or APs recorded with the patch clamp technique. Beat-to-beat alternations of AP morphology and CaT amplitude revealed a strong quantitative correlation. Application of voltage clamp protocols in the form of pre-recorded APs (AP-clamp) during pacing-induced CaT alternans revealed a Ca(2+)-dependent current consisting of a large outward component (4.78 \u00c2\u00b1 0.58 pA pF(-1) in amplitude) coinciding with AP phases 1 and 2 that was followed by an inward current (-0.42 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03 pA pF(-1); n = 21) during AP repolarization.

The prominent AP prolongation at action potential duration at 30% repolarization level during the small alternans CaT was due to reduced ICaCC. Inhibition of Cl(-) currents abolished AP alternans, but failed to affect CaT alternans, indicating that disturbances in Ca(2+) signalling were the primary event leading to alternans, and ICaCC played a decisive role in shaping the beat-to-beat alternations in AP morphology observed during alternans"}, {"phrase": "Ca W3", "id": "9254", "article": "We investigated the effects of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on swelling related properties of mitochondria, with an emphasis on compounds that are marketed and utilized topically in the eye (nepafenac, ketorolac, diclofenac, bromfenac), and compared these to the effects of amfenac (a metabolite of nepafenac) and to celecoxib (active principle of Celebrex). With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism. Potency of those compounds that promote the transition varies widely with bromfenac being the most potent and nepafenac having almost no effect.

Since CA themselves are major mediators of the neural input to the immune system, we have examined their ability to affect PKC-induced TH mRNA expression and CA production in human isolated PBMC. In T- and B-lymphocytes (but not in monocytes) the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (but not its inactive analogue 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate) induced TH mRNA expression which was followed by an increase in the amount of intracellular CA. Coincubation of human PBMC with dopamine (DA) (but not with norepinephrine or epinephrine) inhibited TPA-induced TH mRNA expression. The effect of DA was concentration-dependent and was mimicked by the dopaminergic D1-like receptor agonist SKF-38393 but not by the D2-like receptor agonist bromocriptine. The D1-like antagonist SCH-23390 shifted to the right the concentration-response curves of both DA and SKF-38393, while neither the D2-like antagonist domperidone, nor the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol affected to any significant extent the inhibitory effect of DA. SKF-38393 also significantly reduced TPA-induced increase of intracellular CA, an effect which was antagonized by SCH-23390. It is thus suggested that in human T- and B-lymphocytes PKC activation leads to TH mRNA expression and subsequent increase of intracellular CA, which can be inhibited by D1-like receptor activation.

However, it remains an unresolved issue whether beat-to-beat alternations in intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i ) or AP morphology are the primary cause of pro-arrhythmic alternans. Here we show that in atria AP alternans occurs secondary to CaT alternans. CaT alternans leads to complex beat-to-beat changes in Ca(2+)-regulated ion currents that determine alternans of AP morphology. We report the novel finding that alternans of AP morphology is largely sustained by the activity of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs). Suppression of the CaCCs significantly reduces AP alternans, while CaT alternans remains unaffected. The demonstration of a major role of CaCCs in the development of AP alternans opens new possibilities for atrial alternans and arrhythmia prevention. Cardiac alternans, described as periodic beat-to-beat alternations in contraction, action potential (AP) morphology or cytosolic Ca transient (CaT) amplitude, is a high risk indicator for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. We investigated mechanisms of cardiac alternans in single rabbit atrial myocytes. CaTs were monitored simultaneously with membrane currents or APs recorded with the patch clamp technique. Beat-to-beat alternations of AP morphology and CaT amplitude revealed a strong quantitative correlation. Application of voltage clamp protocols in the form of pre-recorded APs (AP-clamp) during pacing-induced CaT alternans revealed a Ca(2+)-dependent current consisting of a large outward component (4.78 \u00c2\u00b1 0.58 pA pF(-1) in amplitude) coinciding with AP phases 1 and 2 that was followed by an inward current (-0.42 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03 pA pF(-1); n = 21) during AP repolarization. Approximately 90% of the initial outward current was blocked by substitution of Cl(-) ions or application of the Cl(-) channel blocker DIDS identifying it as a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (ICaCC). The prominent AP prolongation at action potential duration at 30% repolarization level during the small alternans CaT was due to reduced ICaCC. Inhibition of Cl(-) currents abolished AP alternans, but failed to affect CaT alternans, indicating that disturbances in Ca(2+) signalling were the primary event leading to alternans, and ICaCC played a decisive role in shaping the beat-to-beat alternations in AP morphology observed during alternans"}, {"phrase": "Ca photosystem II", "id": "9254", "article": "We investigated the effects of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on swelling related properties of mitochondria, with an emphasis on compounds that are marketed and utilized topically in the eye (nepafenac, ketorolac, diclofenac, bromfenac), and compared these to the effects of amfenac (a metabolite of nepafenac) and to celecoxib (active principle of Celebrex). With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide. When used at 200 microM the order of potency is celecoxib > bromfenac > diclofenac > ketorolac > amfenac > nepafenac approximately equal to 0. Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism. Potency of those compounds that promote the transition varies widely with bromfenac being the most potent and nepafenac having almost no effect.

Single-crystal diffraction analysis revealed that all the complexes were mononuclear molecules, in which the Schiff base ligand exhibited different coordination modes and conformations. The N-HO and O-HO inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions linked these molecules into multidimensional networks. Their interactions with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) were investigated by UV-visible and fluorescence spectrometry, as well as by viscosity measurements. The magnitude of the Kapp values of the four complexes was 10(5), indicating a moderate intercalative binding mode between the complexes and DNA. Electrophoresis results showed that all these complexes induced double strand breaks of pUC19 plasmid DNA in the presence of H2O2 through an oxidative pathway. In addition, the fluorescence spectrum of human serum albumin (HSA) with the complexes suggested that the quenching mechanism of HSA by the complexes was a static process. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity of the four complexes against HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) and HepG-2 (human liver hepatocellular carcinoma) cells evaluated by colorimetric cell proliferation assay and clonogenic assay revealed that all four complexes had improved cytotoxicity against cancer cells.

Copper ion addition increased ROS generation in OLA treated macrophages without affecting OLA-NO2 treated cells. These effects could be attributed to elevated glutathione levels and to increased activity and expression of paraoxonase2 that were observed in OLA-NO2 vs OLA treated cells. Beneficial effects on triglyceride metabolism were noted in OLA-NO2 vs OLA treated macrophages in which cellular triglycerides were reduced due to attenuated biosynthesis and accelerated hydrolysis of triglycerides. Accordingly, OLA-NO2 treated cells demonstrated down-regulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase1, the key enzyme in triglyceride biosynthesis, and increased expression of hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase that regulate triglyceride hydrolysis. Finally, OLA-NO2 vs OLA treatment resulted in modest but significant beneficial effects on macrophage cholesterol metabolism, reducing cholesterol biosynthesis rate and low density lipoprotein influx into the cells, while increasing high density lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages.

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) could surmount the deficiencies of culture-based methods; however, there are no standardized, automated programs to process NGS data. To address this deficiency, we developed the Rapid Infectious Disease Identification (RIDI\u00e2\u0084\u00a2) system. The system requires minimal guidance, which reduces operator errors. The system is compatible with the three major NGS platforms. It automatically interfaces with the sequencing system, detects their data format, configures the analysis type, applies appropriate quality control, and analyzes the results. Sequence information is characterized using both the NCBI database and RIDI\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 specific databases. RIDI\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 was designed to identify high probability sequence matches and more divergent matches that could represent different or novel species. We challenged the system using defined American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) reference standards of 27 species, both individually and in varying combinations. The system was able to rapidly detect known organisms in <12h with multi-sample throughput. The system accurately identifies 99.5% of the DNA sequence reads at the genus-level and 75.3% at the species-level in reference standards. It has a limit of detection of 146cells/ml in simulated clinical samples, and is also able to identify the components of polymicrobial samples with 16.9% discrepancy at the genus-level and 31.2% at the species-level.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed.

A silty-loam soil was amended with three different organic residues and with the biochar produced from these residues and incubated for 237 d.

The appearance of Faraday A terms in the MCD spectra demonstrates the presence of a magnetic moment, and thus, uncompensated electronic current. The value of the excited state magnetic moment estimated from the A term is very low compared with those of monomeric porphyrins, which confirms the nonaromatic character of the cyclic array and the lack of a global ring current in the ground state of the neutral nanoring.

The appearance of Faraday A terms in the MCD spectra demonstrates the presence of a magnetic moment, and thus, uncompensated electronic current. The value of the excited state magnetic moment estimated from the A term is very low compared with those of monomeric porphyrins, which confirms the nonaromatic character of the cyclic array and the lack of a global ring current in the ground state of the neutral nanoring.

However, over time, while the overall size of the CDs does not change, aromatic domains form and grow, resulting in a second, faster decay channel at similar wavelengths and also creating additional lower energetic states.

Here we examine the yields and composition of SOA formed from the reaction of OH with a series of C10 (cyclo)alkanes, with 0-3 rings, in order to better understand the role of multiple cyclic moieties on aerosol formation pathways. A chamber oxidation technique using high, sustained OH radical concentrations was used to simulate long reaction times in the atmosphere. This aging technique leads to higher yields than in previously reported chamber experiments. Yields were highest for cyclic and polycyclic precursors, though yield exhibited little dependence on number of rings. However, the oxygen-to-carbon ratio of the SOA was highest for the polycyclic precursors. These trends are consistent with aerosol formation requiring two generations of oxidation and 3-4 oxygen-containing functional groups in order to condense. Cyclic, unbranched structures are protected from fragmentation during the first oxidation step, with C-C bond scission instead leading to ring opening, efficient functionalization, and high SOA yields. Fragmentation may occur during subsequent oxidation steps, limiting yields by forming volatile products. Polycyclic structures can undergo multiple ring opening reactions, but do not have markedly higher yields, likely due to enhanced fragmentation in the second oxidation step. By contrast, C-C bond scission for the linear and branched structures leads to fragmentation prior to condensation, resulting in low SOA yields.

Therefore, there is a major effort to target PPIs in basic research and in the pharmaceutical industry. Protein-protein interfaces are usually large, flat, and often lack pockets, complicating the discovery of small molecules that target such sites. Alternative targeting approaches using antibodies have limitations due to poor oral bioavailability, low cell-permeability, and production inefficiency. Using peptides to target PPI interfaces has several advantages. Peptides have higher conformational flexibility, increased selectivity, and are generally inexpensive. However, peptides have their own limitations including poor stability and inefficiency crossing cell membranes. To overcome such limitations, peptide cyclization can be performed. Cyclization has been demonstrated to improve peptide selectivity, metabolic stability, and bioavailability. However, predicting the bioactive conformation of a cyclic peptide is not trivial. To overcome this challenge, one attractive approach it to screen a focused library to screen in which all backbone cyclic peptides have the same primary sequence, but differ in parameters that influence their conformation, such as ring size and position. We describe a detailed protocol for synthesizing a library of backbone cyclic peptides targeting specific parasite PPIs. Using a rational design approach, we developed peptides derived from the scaffold protein Leishmania receptor for activated C-kinase (LACK). We hypothesized that sequences in LACK that are conserved in parasites, but not in the mammalian host homolog, may represent interaction sites for proteins that are critical for the parasites' viability.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

A chamber oxidation technique using high, sustained OH radical concentrations was used to simulate long reaction times in the atmosphere. This aging technique leads to higher yields than in previously reported chamber experiments. Yields were highest for cyclic and polycyclic precursors, though yield exhibited little dependence on number of rings. However, the oxygen-to-carbon ratio of the SOA was highest for the polycyclic precursors. These trends are consistent with aerosol formation requiring two generations of oxidation and 3-4 oxygen-containing functional groups in order to condense. Cyclic, unbranched structures are protected from fragmentation during the first oxidation step, with C-C bond scission instead leading to ring opening, efficient functionalization, and high SOA yields. Fragmentation may occur during subsequent oxidation steps, limiting yields by forming volatile products. Polycyclic structures can undergo multiple ring opening reactions, but do not have markedly higher yields, likely due to enhanced fragmentation in the second oxidation step.

Therefore, there is a major effort to target PPIs in basic research and in the pharmaceutical industry. Protein-protein interfaces are usually large, flat, and often lack pockets, complicating the discovery of small molecules that target such sites. Alternative targeting approaches using antibodies have limitations due to poor oral bioavailability, low cell-permeability, and production inefficiency. Using peptides to target PPI interfaces has several advantages. Peptides have higher conformational flexibility, increased selectivity, and are generally inexpensive. However, peptides have their own limitations including poor stability and inefficiency crossing cell membranes. To overcome such limitations, peptide cyclization can be performed. Cyclization has been demonstrated to improve peptide selectivity, metabolic stability, and bioavailability. However, predicting the bioactive conformation of a cyclic peptide is not trivial. To overcome this challenge, one attractive approach it to screen a focused library to screen in which all backbone cyclic peptides have the same primary sequence, but differ in parameters that influence their conformation, such as ring size and position. We describe a detailed protocol for synthesizing a library of backbone cyclic peptides targeting specific parasite PPIs. Using a rational design approach, we developed peptides derived from the scaffold protein Leishmania receptor for activated C-kinase (LACK). We hypothesized that sequences in LACK that are conserved in parasites, but not in the mammalian host homolog, may represent interaction sites for proteins that are critical for the parasites' viability.

The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed.

Copper ion addition increased ROS generation in OLA treated macrophages without affecting OLA-NO2 treated cells. These effects could be attributed to elevated glutathione levels and to increased activity and expression of paraoxonase2 that were observed in OLA-NO2 vs OLA treated cells. Beneficial effects on triglyceride metabolism were noted in OLA-NO2 vs OLA treated macrophages in which cellular triglycerides were reduced due to attenuated biosynthesis and accelerated hydrolysis of triglycerides. Accordingly, OLA-NO2 treated cells demonstrated down-regulation of diacylglycerol acyltransferase1, the key enzyme in triglyceride biosynthesis, and increased expression of hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase that regulate triglyceride hydrolysis. Finally, OLA-NO2 vs OLA treatment resulted in modest but significant beneficial effects on macrophage cholesterol metabolism, reducing cholesterol biosynthesis rate and low density lipoprotein influx into the cells, while increasing high density lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages.

Metabolite profiling by targeted LC-MS/MS demonstrated that SepH deficiency impairs redox balance by reducing the levels of ascorbate and methionine, while increasing methionine sulfoxide. Transcriptome analysis revealed that SepH deficiency induces an inflammatory response and activates the p53 pathway. Consequently, loss of seph renders larvae susceptible to oxidative stress and DNA damage. Finally, we demonstrate that seph interacts with p53 deficiency in adulthood to accelerate gastrointestinal tumor development.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.
