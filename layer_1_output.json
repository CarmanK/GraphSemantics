To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide.

Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only.

We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA."}, {"phrase": "Sr sulfite", "id": "10891", "article": "Suppression ratio (SR) derived from bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is correlated to EEG burst suppression.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide.

Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only. The same is true for ruthenium red (inhibitor of the Ca(2+) uniporter), for cyclosporin A (inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition), and for a 3.4 kDa polyethylene glycol (polymer that cancels the force which drives swelling following the permeability transition). It is concluded that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs promote the mitochondrial permeability transition under conditions of oxidative stress and in a Ca(2+) dependent fashion, whereas celecoxib functions by another mechanism.

With the exception of the last compound, none of the drugs promote swelling of normal mitochondria that are well energized by succinate oxidation. However, swelling is seen when the mitochondria are under an oxidative stress due to the presence of t-butylhydroperoxide.

Again with the exception of celecoxib, this swelling is not seen when mitochondria are depleted of endogenous Ca(2+) and is accelerated when exogenous Ca(2+) is provided. Sr(2+) does not substitute for exogenous Ca(2+) and prevents swelling in the presence of endogenous Ca(2+) only.

Since CA themselves are major mediators of the neural input to the immune system, we have examined their ability to affect PKC-induced TH mRNA expression and CA production in human isolated PBMC. In T- and B-lymphocytes (but not in monocytes) the PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (but not its inactive analogue 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate) induced TH mRNA expression which was followed by an increase in the amount of intracellular CA. Coincubation of human PBMC with dopamine (DA) (but not with norepinephrine or epinephrine) inhibited TPA-induced TH mRNA expression. The effect of DA was concentration-dependent and was mimicked by the dopaminergic D1-like receptor agonist SKF-38393 but not by the D2-like receptor agonist bromocriptine. The D1-like antagonist SCH-23390 shifted to the right the concentration-response curves of both DA and SKF-38393, while neither the D2-like antagonist domperidone, nor the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, or the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol affected to any significant extent the inhibitory effect of DA. SKF-38393 also significantly reduced TPA-induced increase of intracellular CA, an effect which was antagonized by SCH-23390. It is thus suggested that in human T- and B-lymphocytes PKC activation leads to TH mRNA expression and subsequent increase of intracellular CA, which can be inhibited by D1-like receptor activation. Inhibition of intracellular CA production in human PBMC promotes cell survival through reduction of activation-induced apoptosis, and dopaminergic modulation of TH expression and intracellular CA content may thus represent a novel mechanism in the cross-talk between the nervous and the immune system as well as among immune system cells"}, {"phrase": "Sr Ca", "id": "7961", "article": "Pyomyositis is infrequently reported in patients with multiple myeloma.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

However, these recommendations are largely based on observational data. The aim of this systematic review (SR) was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in brain-dead potential organ donors. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from the earliest accessible date up to March 2013 with a qualified librarian. Studies comparing the effects of any corticosteroid with those of placebo, standard treatment, or another active comparator were sought. Two independent reviewers evaluated each citation retrieved and selected studies independently and in duplicate. A third independent reviewer resolved any disagreement. Outcomes included donor haemodynamics and oxygenation, organ procurement, recipient survival, and graft survival. This review included 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. The majority used methylprednisolone and often combined it with other hormonal therapies. Ten out of the 11 RCTs yielded neutral results. However, in observational studies, use of corticosteroids generally resulted in improved donor haemodynamics and oxygenation status, increased organ procurement, and improved recipient and graft survival. Overall quality of included studies was poor, as most of them presented high risks of confounding. This SR highlights the low quality and conflicting evidence supporting the routine use of corticosteroids in the management of organ donors.

Furthermore, the repression of CYP3A4 by IL-6 occurred after the increase of DEC1 in primary human hepatocytes. In HepG2 cells, knockdown of DEC1 increased the CYP3A4 expression and its enzymatic activity. In addition, it partially abolished the decreased CYP3A4 expression as well as its enzymatic activity induced by IL-6. Consistent with this, overexpression of DEC1 markedly reduced the CYP3A4 promoter activity and the CYP3A4 expression as well as its enzymatic activity. Using sequential truncation and site directed mutagenesis of CYP3A4 proximal promoter with DEC1 construct, we showed that DEC1 specifically bound to CCCTGC sequence in the proximal promoter of CYP3A4, which was validated by EMSA and ChIP assay. These findings suggest that the repression of CYP3A4 by IL-6 is achieved through increasing the DEC1 expression in human hepatocytes, the increased DEC1 binds to the CCCTGC sequence in the promoter of CYP3A4 to form CCCTGC-DEC1 complex, and the complex downregulates the CYP3A4 expression and its enzymatic activity"}, {"phrase": "Sr enzymatic", "id": "16709", "article": "In our series, the treatment with SR brachytherapy resulted in less morbidity and an improved final SM(-) rate.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation.

PPAR\u00ce\u00b3, ABCA1, ABCG1, SR-BI, CD36, and LXR-\u00ce\u00b1 mRNA were quantified by Real-Time PCR. Western blotting was used to determine protein expression of PPAR\u00ce\u00b3, ABCA1 and CD36. Cellular cholesterol handling was studied by measurement of intracellular lipid droplets concentration and cholesterol efflux. DSS significantly reduced scavenger receptor CD36 and its orthologue SR-BI. In addition, DSS stimulated the upregulation of cellular cholesterol exporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 to reduce intracellular lipid accumulation. DSS can reduce lipid deposition in Raw264.7 foam cells by balancing CD36 and ABCA1 protein expression"}, {"phrase": "ATCC sulfite", "id": "6", "article": "The octahaem MccA is a haem c-copper sulfite reductase The six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide is the pivot point of the biogeochemical cycle of the element sulfur. The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA."}, {"phrase": "ATCC sulfite", "id": "5", "article": "The primary and three-dimensional structures of a nine-haem cytochrome c from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 reveal a new member of the Hmc family Haem-containing proteins are directly involved in electron transfer as well as in enzymatic functions.

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) could surmount the deficiencies of culture-based methods; however, there are no standardized, automated programs to process NGS data. To address this deficiency, we developed the Rapid Infectious Disease Identification (RIDI\u00e2\u0084\u00a2) system. The system requires minimal guidance, which reduces operator errors. The system is compatible with the three major NGS platforms. It automatically interfaces with the sequencing system, detects their data format, configures the analysis type, applies appropriate quality control, and analyzes the results. Sequence information is characterized using both the NCBI database and RIDI\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 specific databases. RIDI\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 was designed to identify high probability sequence matches and more divergent matches that could represent different or novel species. We challenged the system using defined American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) reference standards of 27 species, both individually and in varying combinations. The system was able to rapidly detect known organisms in <12h with multi-sample throughput. The system accurately identifies 99.5% of the DNA sequence reads at the genus-level and 75.3% at the species-level in reference standards. It has a limit of detection of 146cells/ml in simulated clinical samples, and is also able to identify the components of polymicrobial samples with 16.9% discrepancy at the genus-level and 31.2% at the species-level. Thus, the system's effectiveness may exceed current methods, especially in situations where culture methods could produce false negatives or where rapid results would influence patient outcomes"}, {"phrase": "ATCC aromatic ring", "id": "1", "article": "Role of the aromatic ring of Tyr43 in tetraheme cytochrome c(3) from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki  Tyrosine 43 is positioned parallel to the fifth heme axial ligand, His34, of heme 1 in the tetraheme cytochrome c(3). The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics. The mutation of Y43L, however, did not induce a significant change in the crystal structure"}, {"phrase": "ATCC aromatic ring", "id": "5", "article": "The primary and three-dimensional structures of a nine-haem cytochrome c from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 reveal a new member of the Hmc family Haem-containing proteins are directly involved in electron transfer as well as in enzymatic functions.
