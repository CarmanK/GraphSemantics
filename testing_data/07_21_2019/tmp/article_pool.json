Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

These functions are anion transport, ankyrin binding, and generation of senescent cell antigen, an aging antigen that terminates the life of cells. Structural similarity of brain and erythroid band 3 is suggested by the reaction of antibodies to synthetic peptides of erythroid band 3 with brain band 3, the inhibition of anion transport by the same inhibitors, and an equal degree of inhibition of brain and erythrocyte anion transport by synthetic peptides of erythroid band 3 (pep-ANION 2, residues 588-602; pep-COOH, residues 812-827; pep-COOH-N6, residues 813-818). One of these segments, pep-COOH, contains antigenic determinants of senescent cell antigen.

A circular-type, mm-scale electrode with the same diameter as the band-type microelectrode was also made with an electrode area that was 5000 times larger than the band-type microelectrode. By comparing the amperometric signals of 3,5,3',5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) samples at different optical density (OD) values, the band-type microelectrode was determined to be 9 times more sensitive than the circular-type electrode. The properties of the circular-type and the band-type electrodes (e.g., the shape of their cyclic voltammograms, the type of diffusion layer used, and the diffusion layer thickness per unit electrode area) were characterized according to their electrode area using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. From these simulations, the band-type electrode was estimated to have the conventional microelectrode properties, even when the electrode area was 100 times larger than a conventional circular-type electrode. These results show that both the geometry and the area of an electrode can influence the properties of the electrode. Finally, amperometric analysis based on a band-type electrode was applied to commercial ELISA kits to analyze human hepatitis B surface antigen (hHBsAg) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies.

This review emphasizes a structural approach that describes the cellular and extracellular components with known anatomical, biochemical, and physical properties that make them candidates for these contractile and elastic components. Classical models of contractile and elastic elements and their underlying assumptions are presented. Mechanical properties of cardiac and skeletal muscle are compared and contrasted and then related to ultrastructure. Information from these approaches leads to the conclusion that the Z band is essential for muscle contraction. Our review of Z band structure shows the Z band at the interface where extracellular components meet the cell surface. The Z band is also the interface from cell surface to myofibril, from extra-myofibrillar to myofibril, and finally from sarcomere to sarcomere. Our studies of Z band in defined physiologic states show that this lattice is an integral part of the contractile elements and can function as an elastic component. The Z band is a complex dynamic lattice uniquely suited to play several roles in muscle contraction."

The results demonstrate that narrowing of the alar vestibule and the state of the mucosal vasculature both influence maximum flow through the nose; under optimal conditions, nasal flow capacity is close to that via the mouth."

This study describes the trunk motion and paraspinal muscle activity during the swing of a golfer with related low back pain (LBP) and assesses the effect of a 3-month period of muscle conditioning and coaching on these variables. Motion of the trunk was measured using three-dimensional video analysis and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the same six sites of the erector spinae at the start and end of the 3-month period. At the end of the period, the golfer was able to play and practice without LBP. Coaching resulted in an increase in the range of hip turn and a decrease in the amount of shoulder turn, which occurred during the swing. In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae. These changes may serve to reduce the torsional and compressive loads acting on the thoracic and lumbar spine, which in turn may have contributed to the cessation of the LBP and would reduce the risk of reoccurrence in the future. In conclusion, further research with more subjects would now be warranted in order to test the findings of this program for the prevention of low back in golfers as piloted in this case report."

One of the most widely employed strategies for assessing social skill has been role-play tests: simulated social interactions that are videotaped for subsequent behavioral coding. There has been considerable discussion of the validity of the approach in the literature, but there has not been adequate consideration of other psychometric characteristics of role-play tests. This paper examines the psychometric characteristics of a representative role-play measure: the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC). Data from 5 large schizophrenia studies that included the MASC were examined: a study of victimization in women who abuse drugs, a study of health care among people with diabetes, a study of vocational outcomes, a study of social skill among drug abusers, and a clinical trial comparing two antipsychotic medications. Data were examined in terms of five questions: (1) Can role-play scenes be rated reliably? (2) How are role-play ratings distributed across populations? (3) How many and which behaviors should be rated? (4) How many role-play scenes are required? (5) Is role-play behavior temporally stable? Overall, the data suggest that the MASC, and by implication other similar role-play procedures, does have good psychometric properties. However, several things often taken for granted in the literature warrant careful consideration in the design of research using role-play. Implications of the results for design of research are discussed."

The experiment was performed by obtaining information through a questionnaire from third and fifth grade students in four elementary schools. The results indicate the followings.

The proportions of decentred and decontextualized acts, action integrations and play themes, increased linearly with age. Changes in substitutive and inventive actions were, however, more minor than expected. Single-scheme combinations did not reveal any essential aspect of the development of children's symbolic competence. In this sense, multischeme combinations were more important in revealing the children's way of organizing toy material. Linear age trends were not found for language measures. The use of decentred utterances, language integrations and linguistically expressed themes were individual-specific rather than age-related.

We report a retrospective analysis of 77 allogeneic bone marrow transplantation recipients who received simultaneous upper and lower GI tract biopsies. Upper GI GVHD was found in 44% of patients, of whom 59% also had a positive lower GI tract biopsy (P less than 0.001). Thirty-five percent of the patients with no clinical evidence of lower GI tract GVHD had symptomatic upper GI GVHD confirmed histologically. Patients with and without upper GI GVHD had no significant difference in their clinical symptoms or in their endoscopic findings. We found an association between upper GI and skin GVHD greater than stage I (P = 0.05), a trend to concordance between upper GI GVHD and clinical GVHD in the lower GI tract (P = 0.08), and with the overall clinical GVHD grade (P = 0.08) but no association with clinical liver involvement. Of these 77 patients, 16% had their treatment for acute GVHD changed to include systemic immunosuppression as a result of the upper GI endoscopic biopsy. In addition, 71% had other enteric pathology identified that required specific therapy. These data suggest that upper GI GVHD cannot be diagnosed accurately from its clinical presentation nor inferred from lower GI symptoms or from extraintestinal GVHD. Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy is an important tool in the diagnosis of intestinal GVHD."

Here, we quantitated HMG CoA reductase activity after acute and chronic barrier disruption in the upper and lower layers of murine epidermis. In unperturbed epidermis, 13 and 87% of enzyme activity localized to the upper and lower epidermis, respectively, with the majority of activity in the stratum basale. Acute barrier disruption with either acetone or sodium dodecylsulfate provoked an increase in HMG CoA reductase activity (54% and 30%) in the lower layers, but only a small change in the upper layers. However, the activation state of the enzyme was increased 50% in the upper epidermis. Correction of barrier function by occlusion with an impermeable Latex wrap prevented the increase both in enzyme activity and activation state. After chronic barrier disruption; i.e., essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD) diet, HMG CoA reductase activity was increased in the upper epidermis (161%); a change prevented by occlusion. These results show: (1) that HMG CoA reductase activity is present in both the upper and lower cell layers; (2) that acute insults to barrier integrity stimulate enzyme activity in both the upper and lower epidermis; and (3) that chronic insults provoke an increase in enzyme activity in the upper layers.

Understanding the water use strategy of dominant species in the alpine sandy land ecosystem is important for vegetative rehabilitation and ecological restoration. The stable isotope methodology of \u03b4D, \u03b418O, and \u03b413C was used to determine main water source and long-term water use efficiency of Salix psammophila and S. cheilophila, two dominant shrubs on interdune of alpine sandy land in northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The root systems of two Salix shrubs were investigated to determine their distribution pattern. The results showed that S. psammophila and S. cheilophila absorbed soil water at different soil depths or ground water in different seasons, depending on water availability and water use strategy. Salix psammophila used ground water during the growing season and relied on shallow soil water recharged by rain in summer. Salix cheilophila used ground water in spring and summer, but relied on shallow soil water recharged by rain in spring and deep soil water recharged by ground water in fall. The two shrubs had dimorphic root systems, which is coincident with their water use strategy. Higher biomass of fine roots in S. psammophila and longer fine roots in S. cheilophila facilitated to absorb water in deeper soil layers. The long-term water use efficiency of two Salix shrubs increased during the dry season in spring. The long-term water use efficiency was higher in S. psammophila than in S. cheilophila, as the former species is better adapted to semiarid climate of alpine sandy land. "

The exact derivation of water requirement and more detailed knowledge about the actual water consumption of each animal is only required if water supply is limited or too expensive to be provided in abundance. In case of limited water supply the water requirement is of special interest in order to prevent negative effects on animal health, performance or welfare. Intentions for water restriction or reasons for an accidental reduced water intake are quite different and variable in animal husbandry or keeping of companion animals. The following conditions only represent a few examples: water restriction in order to keep the litter dry (for example in poultry houses), due to technical problems concerning water supply like blocked-up waterers or failure to estimate the water requirement correctly (e.g. pet rabbits fed on concentrate and carrots without any additional water). Water consumption measured under conventional housing conditions (in litre per kg dry matter intake) varies in a wide range (from < 1:1 up to > 4:1) from one species to another. With higher performance leading to increased feed intake, water consumption usually also rises. For this reason it is very useful to calculate water consumption in relation to dry matter intake only. Besides there are several other factors of practical concern that have great influence on water intake: environmental temperature, intake of nutrients, that must be eliminated via the kidneys (e.g. electrolytes, nitrogen), as well as the amount of water spent for certain products like the sweat in horses or cow's milk. The importance of adequate water supply is best understood regarding the consequences of water deprivation (reduced feed intake, concentration of urine, impaired thermoregulation, reduced renal excretion of metabolic waste products, intake of other fluids that may be critical with regard to hygiene, behavioural problems). Because of the consequences of an inadequate water intake for animal welfare--last but not least--legislation on keeping animals provides guidelines for water supply that are controlled (among others) by veterinary administration."

Although water intoxication was recognized nearly 70 years ago, the physiological basis of these disorders of water metabolism still remains elusive. This review will provide a historical overview, critique current studies on compulsive water drinking and SIWI, discuss possible etiologies, and present current approaches to treatment of these disorders. Because of the complexity of the subject, a review of normal water homeostasis and the SIADH will be included."

The system provides easy access for the patient who needs a continuous supply of medication or repeated blood sampling. To ensure no obstruction of flow, the system must be flushed to clear the port and catheter, making it important to establish the clearance parameters. These parameters can be obtained by use of a tetrapolar impedance cell to monitor the relative impedance change using two solutions of different impedances to fill and flush the system. The resulting impedance dilution curve allows calculation of time delay, dilution time, clearance time, and clearance volume. This method and resulting data may be used to characterize a portal vascular access system and provide a basis for comparative analysis of newly introduced systems."

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

Daily sleep data showed statistically significant seasonal patterns in all 10 patients (with 6 subjects showing maximum sleep in winter and 4 in summer).

This study describes the trunk motion and paraspinal muscle activity during the swing of a golfer with related low back pain (LBP) and assesses the effect of a 3-month period of muscle conditioning and coaching on these variables. Motion of the trunk was measured using three-dimensional video analysis and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the same six sites of the erector spinae at the start and end of the 3-month period. At the end of the period, the golfer was able to play and practice without LBP. Coaching resulted in an increase in the range of hip turn and a decrease in the amount of shoulder turn, which occurred during the swing. In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae. These changes may serve to reduce the torsional and compressive loads acting on the thoracic and lumbar spine, which in turn may have contributed to the cessation of the LBP and would reduce the risk of reoccurrence in the future. In conclusion, further research with more subjects would now be warranted in order to test the findings of this program for the prevention of low back in golfers as piloted in this case report."

With miniaturized sensor devices, continuous medical monitoring of patients to detect transient life threatening conditions from daily activities has been made possible. This phenomenon will certainly improve the quality of life for a majority of people. However, the growing variety of sensor devices in the market, has made application developments very challenging. In light of this view, we are proposing SLIM, a lightweight middleware that shields the underlying differences in sensor technology from the application layer. SLIM is designed to simplify/accelerate application development while not simply providing common middleware functions (i.e. data acquisition and plug-and-play capability) but also others like security and interactive features. To support both indoor and outdoor activities, SLIM is built to reside on mobile devices. At the end of the paper, we will show the prototype of the proposed middleware including its functionalities when used with a mobile application."

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

In a lesser number of subjects (four), there were significant effects of weather after controlling for season; however, when the effects of weather on energy were examined separately for each season, 8 of the 10 subjects were found to be influenced by weather in at least one season. Daily sleep data showed statistically significant seasonal patterns in all 10 patients (with 6 subjects showing maximum sleep in winter and 4 in summer).

In addition to recording self-selected speeds and total distance covered the authors assessed the runners' subjective feelings. The total distance covered was greater during the CHO than during the PLA trial (p < .05). Faster speeds selected during the first 5 min of exercise corresponded with enhanced feelings of pleasure when mouth rinsing with the CHO solution. Mouth rinsing with a CHO solution increased total distance covered during a self-selected 30-min run in comparison with mouth rinsing with a color- and taste-matched placebo."

For each subject, the displacement of the lower interincisal point, the path of the condylar reference point, the degree of rotation around the three orthogonal rotational axes, and the relative contribution of translation and rotation were calculated during all movement of mouth opening and closing. The distance covered by the interincisor point and the rotational angle about the transverse axis at maximum mouth opening were larger in men than in women, but the difference cancelled after correcting for mandibular radius in the sagittal plane; mandibular rotation was always larger than translation, but never approaching 100%; opening and closing translations were similar within sex, but their paths were longer in men than in women (P < 0.05); rotational angles around vertical and sagittal axes were negligible; the linear correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was minor and not significant. In normal subjects, mouth opening and closing as modeled at the interincisor point was determined more by mandibular rotation than by translation, but in no occasion a pure rotation was found. The percentage rotation was not identical during mouth opening and closing; female and male paths were not totally coincident; no correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was found."

Under baseline conditions maximum flow via the nose was lower than that via the mouth in the upper 50-60% of the VC on expiration and throughout the VC on inspiration. The mean ratio of maximum inspiratory to maximum expiratory flow at mid-VC was 1.38 during mouth breathing and 0.62 during nasal breathing. Inspiratory flow limitation with no increase in flow through the nose as driving pressure was increased above a critical value (usually between 12 and 30 cmH2O) was found in all six subjects studied. Stenting the alae nasi in seven subjects increased peak flow via the nose from a mean of 3.49 to 4.32 l/s on inspiration and from 4.83 to 5.61 l/s on expiration. Topical application of an alpha-adrenergic agonist in seven subjects increased mean peak nasal flow on inspiration from 3.25 to 3.89 l/s and on expiration from 5.03 to 7.09 l/s. Further increases in peak flow occurred with subsequent alan stenting. With the combination of stenting and topical mucosal vasoconstriction, nasal peak flow on expiration reached 81% and, on inspiration, 79% of corresponding peak flows via the mouth. The results demonstrate that narrowing of the alar vestibule and the state of the mucosal vasculature both influence maximum flow through the nose; under optimal conditions, nasal flow capacity is close to that via the mouth."

Classical models of contractile and elastic elements and their underlying assumptions are presented. Mechanical properties of cardiac and skeletal muscle are compared and contrasted and then related to ultrastructure. Information from these approaches leads to the conclusion that the Z band is essential for muscle contraction. Our review of Z band structure shows the Z band at the interface where extracellular components meet the cell surface. The Z band is also the interface from cell surface to myofibril, from extra-myofibrillar to myofibril, and finally from sarcomere to sarcomere. Our studies of Z band in defined physiologic states show that this lattice is an integral part of the contractile elements and can function as an elastic component. The Z band is a complex dynamic lattice uniquely suited to play several roles in muscle contraction."

This is a new class of hybrid semiconducting materials where optoelectronic properties of inorganic core (SnI4) were tuned by organic ligands. The valence band is located at the inorganic portion of the molecule while the conduction band is made of carbon-based orbitals. This suggests the great importance of hydrogen bonds where iodine atoms play the role of an acceptor. Weak intermolecular interactions between iodine atoms and aromatic rings are essential in a band structure formation. These materials form orange-red crystals soluble in most of organic solvents. Their semiconducting properties are addressed experimentally via photovoltage measurements, as well as theoretically, using DFT and semiempirical approaches. "

Structural similarity of brain and erythroid band 3 is suggested by the reaction of antibodies to synthetic peptides of erythroid band 3 with brain band 3, the inhibition of anion transport by the same inhibitors, and an equal degree of inhibition of brain and erythrocyte anion transport by synthetic peptides of erythroid band 3 (pep-ANION 2, residues 588-602; pep-COOH, residues 812-827; pep-COOH-N6, residues 813-818).

By comparing the amperometric signals of 3,5,3',5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) samples at different optical density (OD) values, the band-type microelectrode was determined to be 9 times more sensitive than the circular-type electrode. The properties of the circular-type and the band-type electrodes (e.g., the shape of their cyclic voltammograms, the type of diffusion layer used, and the diffusion layer thickness per unit electrode area) were characterized according to their electrode area using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. From these simulations, the band-type electrode was estimated to have the conventional microelectrode properties, even when the electrode area was 100 times larger than a conventional circular-type electrode. These results show that both the geometry and the area of an electrode can influence the properties of the electrode.

First, it was verified that overshoot is largely independent of masker duration. Second, overshoot was determined for a variety of 10-ms masker bursts composed of differently filtered uniform masking noise with an overall level of 60 dB SPL: unfiltered, high-pass (cutoff at 3700 Hz), low-pass (cutoff at 5700 Hz), and third-octave-band-(centered at 5000 Hz) filtered uniform masking noises presented separately or combined with different bandpass maskers (5700-16000 Hz, 5700-9500 Hz, 8400-16000 Hz) were used. Third, masked thresholds were measured for maskers composed of an upper or lower octave band adjacent to the third-octave-band masker as a function of the level of the octave band. All maskers containing components above the critical band of the test tone led to overshoot; no additional overshoot was produced by masker components below it. Typical values of overshoot were on the order of 12 dB. Overshoot saturated when masker levels were above 60 dB SPL for the upper octave-band masker. The standard neurophysiological explanation of overshoot accounts only partially for these data. Details that must be accommodated by any full explanation of overshoot are discussed."

In cats and rhesus monkeys, DCX+ cells existed across the allo- and neocortex, with an overall ventrodorsal high to low gradient at a given frontal plane. Labeled cells formed a cellular band in layers II and upper III, exhibiting dramatic differences in somal size (5-20 microm), shape (unipolar, bipolar, multipolar and irregular), neuritic complexity and labeling intensity. Cell clusters were also seen in this band, and those in the entorhinal cortex extended into deeper layers as chain-like structures. Densitometry revealed a parallel decline of the cells across regions with age in cats. Besides the cellular band, medium-sized cells with weak DCX reactivity resided sparsely in other layers. Throughout the cortex, virtually all DCX+ cells co-expressed polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule. Medium to large mature-looking DCX+ cells frequently colocalized with neuron-specific nuclear protein and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and those with a reduced DCX expression also partially co-labeled for glutamic acid decarboxylase, parvalbumin, calbindin, beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Similar to cats and monkeys, small and larger DCX+ cells were detected in surgically removed human frontal and temporal cortices.

The elastic band of the lower opening effectively draws said lower opening into relatively tight contact with the outer surface of the golf bag. The length of the sleeve is such that at least a portion of said sleeve extends a sufficient distance from the golf bag to collapse the sleeve whereby the upper opening is positioned in substantially the same direction as the lower opening.

This novel spectral feature suggests the existence of an oriented water cluster species which has penetrated or accommodated into the Langmuir monolayer of the 8CB and 5CB molecules. This finding provided a molecular level mechanism for the stark difference in the phase behaviour between the CB and CT insoluble Langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface. It also calls for attention to the details of the specific water-surface interaction in mediating the structure and the phase behaviour of the molecular assemblies at the heterogeneous aqueous interfaces."

Q(B) accepts electrons from the primary quinone, Q(A), in two sequential electron transfer reactions coupled to uptake of a proton from solution. It has been suggested that water molecules along the proton uptake pathway are protonated upon quinone reduction on the basis of FTIR difference spectra [Breton, J., and Nabedryk, E. (1998) Photosynth. Res. 55, 301-307]. We examined the possible involvement of water molecules in the photoreaction processes by studying (18)O water isotope effects on FTIR difference spectra resulting from formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-). Continuum bands in D(2)O due to Q(B)(-) formation in the 2300-1800 cm(-1) region did not show spectral shifts by (18)O water in the wild-type (WT) RC, suggesting that these bands do not originate from (protonated) water. In contrast, the Q(B)(-)/Q(B) spectrum of the EQ-L212 mutant RC showed a spectral shift of a band near 2100 cm(-1) due to (18)O water substitution, consistent with protonation of internal water. FTIR shifts due to (18)O water were also observed following formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-) in the spectral region of 3700-3500 cm(-1) characteristic of weakly hydrogen bonded water. The water responsible for the Q(B)(-) change was localized near Glu-L212 by spectral shifts in mutant RCs. The weakly hydrogen bonded water perturbed by quinone reduction may play a role in stabilizing the charge-separated state."

By optimizing the nutation angles of the individual pulses, the water and lipid suppression is made insensitive to a range of both T1-relaxation times and B1 inhomogeneities. The method consists only of preparatory RF pulses and thus can be combined with a wide variety of MRSI schemes including both long and short TE studies. Simulations yield suppression factors, in the presence of +/-20% B1 inhomogeneity, on the order of 100 for lipid peaks with three different T1s (300 ms, 310 ms, and 360 ms), and water peaks with T1s ranging from 0.8 s to 4 s. Excellent in vivo study performance is demonstrated using a 3 Tesla volumetric proton spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) sequence for measuring the primary brain metabolites peaks of choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)."

The absorption, diffuse reflectance, and emission spectra of ice samples containing anisole prepared by different techniques, such as slow freezing (frozen aqueous solutions), shock freezing (ice grains), or anisole vapor deposition on ice grains, were measured to evaluate changes in the contaminated ice matrix that occur at different temperatures. It was found that the position of the lowest absorption band of anisole and its tail shift bathochromically by \u223c4 nm in frozen samples compared to liquid aqueous solutions. On the other hand, the emission spectra of aqueous anisole solutions were found to fundamentally change upon freezing. While one emission band (\u223c290 nm) was observed under all circumstances, the second band at \u223c350 nm, assigned to an anisole excimer, appeared only at certain temperatures (150-250 K). Its disappearance at lower temperatures is attributed to the formation of crystalline anisole on the ice surface. DFT and ADC(2) calculations were used to interpret the absorption and emission spectra of anisole monomer and dimer associates. Various stable arrangements of the anisole associates were found at the disordered water-air interface in the ground and excited states, but only those with a substantial overlap of the aromatic rings are manifested by the emission band at \u223c350 nm.

Coronal sections 25 mum thick were cut through the BF regions and processed every 200 mum for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry. The ALCAR-treated rats had significantly shorter exit times on the Morris maze-water task test than the control rats (ANOVA-enzyme: F(1,39)=112.5, P=0.0001; sessions: F(3,39)=10.41, P=0.0001; interaction: F(3,39)=5.09, P=0.0044).

In the diagonal band of Broca (P<0.0494) and in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus (P<0.0117) there were significantly fewer ChAT-positive neurons in the aged control rats than in the ALCAR-treated rats.

The OD hydroxyl stretches of methanol-OD oligomers in CCl(4) and HOD in H(2)O are studied using the shortest mid-IR pulses (<50 fs, <4 cycles of light) produced to date. The pulses have sufficient spectral bandwidth to span the very broad (>400 cm(-1)) spectrum of the 0-1 and 1-2 transitions. Hydrogen bond population dynamics are extricated with exceptional detail in MeOD oligomers because the different hydrogen bonded species are spectrally distinct. The experimental results along with detailed calculations indicate the strongest hydrogen bonds are selectively broken through a non-equilibrium relaxation pathway following vibrational relaxation of the hydroxyl stretch. The correlation spectra are also a sensitive probe of the fluctuations in water and provide a stringent test of water models that are widely used in simulations of aqueous systems. The analysis of the 2D band shapes demonstrates that different hydrogen bonded species are subject to distinct (wavelength dependent) ultrafast (~100 fs) local fluctuations and essentially identical slow (0.4 and ~2 ps) structural rearrangements. Observation of wavelength dependent dynamics demonstrates that standard theoretical approaches assuming Gaussian fluctuations cannot adequately describe water dynamics."

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

These options include prone positioning, the use of a nasal trumpet, and surgery. One surgical technique is the subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth musculature. The theory behind this procedure is that this musculature is under tension, and therefore it pushes the tongue upward and backward, resulting in respiratory obstruction. In theory, the release of this musculature from the mandible should alleviate the tension and hence clear the obstruction. In an attempt to objectively evaluate this theory, we performed subperiosteal release surgery on two infants. Our first patient required an emergent tracheostomy on postoperative day 2 because of the onset of surgically induced airway edema. To avoid this complication in the second patient, we performed a tracheostomy at the same time as surgery. Pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the second patient revealed only a minimal change in the anatomy of the floor of the mouth musculature. We believe the subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth musculature requires further evaluation before it can be considered to be effective in the surgical treatment of respiratory obstruction in Pierre Robin sequence."

Inductive plethysmography was used to measure the percent of nasal breathing, and the pressure-flow technique was used to estimate nasal area in 15 persons with severe nasal airway impairment. Mean nasal area was 0.17 cm2, and the average percent of nasal breathing was 20%. Analysis revealed a strong correlation (0.87) between nasal size and percent of nasal breathing in this selected group. Modeling studies based on the mean values from the subjects' data indicated that the model \"mouth\" would have to open 0.5 cm2 to shunt 80% of the airflow orally, an amount equivalent to the mean value of the subjects' respiratory mode. More important, the extrapolated data revealed that upper-airway resistance decreased in the model from 8.7 cm H2O/L/sec to a level of 3.2 cm H2O/L/sec, which is an average value for healthy adults. These data support the concept that the mouth acts as a variable resistor to maintain an optimal respiratory tract resistance when the nasal airway is impaired."

By investigating children's performance in detecting these emotions from a specific face region, we were interested to know whether children would show differences in recognizing these expressions from the upper or lower face, and if any difference between specific facial regions depended on the emotion in question. For this purpose, a group of 6-7 year-old children was selected. Participants were asked to recognize emotions by using a labeling task with three stimulus types (region of the eyes, of the mouth, and full face). The findings seem to indicate that children correctly recognize basic facial expressions when pictures represent the whole face, except for a neutral expression, which was recognized from the mouth, and sadness, which was recognized from the eyes. Children are also able to identify anger from the eyes as well as from the whole face. With respect to gender differences, there is no female advantage in emotional recognition. The results indicate a significant interaction 'gender x face region' only for anger and neutral emotions. "

For each subject, the displacement of the lower interincisal point, the path of the condylar reference point, the degree of rotation around the three orthogonal rotational axes, and the relative contribution of translation and rotation were calculated during all movement of mouth opening and closing. The distance covered by the interincisor point and the rotational angle about the transverse axis at maximum mouth opening were larger in men than in women, but the difference cancelled after correcting for mandibular radius in the sagittal plane; mandibular rotation was always larger than translation, but never approaching 100%; opening and closing translations were similar within sex, but their paths were longer in men than in women (P < 0.05); rotational angles around vertical and sagittal axes were negligible; the linear correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was minor and not significant. In normal subjects, mouth opening and closing as modeled at the interincisor point was determined more by mandibular rotation than by translation, but in no occasion a pure rotation was found. The percentage rotation was not identical during mouth opening and closing; female and male paths were not totally coincident; no correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was found."

            "article": "Lunge-feeding in rorqual whales represents the largest biomechanical event on Earth and one of the most extreme feeding methods among aquatic vertebrates. By accelerating to high speeds and by opening their mouth to large gape angles, these whales generate the water pressure required to expand their mouth around a large volume of prey-laden water. Such large influx is facilitated by highly extensible ventral groove blubber (VGB) associated with the walls of the throat (buccal cavity). Based on the mechanical properties of this tissue, previous studies have assumed lunge-feeding to be an entirely passive process, where the flow-induced pressure driving the expansion of the VGB is met with little resistance. Such compliant engulfment would be facilitated by the compliant properties of the VGB that have been measured on dead specimens. However, adjoining the ventral blubber are several layers of well-developed muscle embedded with mechanoreceptors, thereby suggesting a capability to gauge the magnitude of engulfed water and use eccentric muscle action to control the flux of water into the mouth. An unsteady hydrodynamic model of fin whale lunge-feeding is presented here to test whether engulfment is exclusively passive and compliant or involves muscle action. The model is based on the explicit simulation of the engulfed water as it interacts with the buccal cavity walls of the whale, under different heuristically motivated cavity forces. Our results, together with their comparison with velocity data collected in the field, suggest that adult rorquals actively push engulfed water forward from the very onset of mouth opening in order to successfully complete a lunge. Interestingly, such an action involves a reflux of the engulfed mass rather than the oft-assumed rebound, which would occur mainly at the very end of a lunge sequence dominated by compliant engulfment. Given the great mass of the engulfed water, reflux creation adds a significant source of hydrodynamic drag to the lunge process, but with the benefit of helping to circumvent the problem of removing prey from baleen by enhancing the efficiency of cross-flow filtration after mouth closing. Reflux management for a successful lunge will therefore demand well-coordinated muscular actions of the tail, mouth and ventral cavity."

The wet and dry weight, pH, and water content of the stools were similar on the two diets. On the high sugar diet mouth-to-anus transit time was significantly prolonged, despite a shortened mouth-to-caecum transit time. The faecal concentration of total bile acids and the faecal concentration of secondary bile acids increased significantly. Diet affected neither the serum bile acid pattern nor the concentration.

The ethanol solution was concurrently available with its water vehicle under fixed-ratio schedules of mouth contacts with a drinking spout in which emission of 8 responses produced a liquid delivery (FR 8). Under these conditions ethanol served as a reinforcer for some subjects--it maintained higher response rates than water--but not for others. In the next experimental condition (Phase 2), subjects were again tested for ethanol self-administration under FR 8 schedules with water concurrently available, but while receiving daily food rations that maintained their body weights at less than what they had been under ad lib feeding conditions. Under these conditions all subjects self-administered ethanol at appreciable levels, but water-maintained responding also was at appreciable levels for some subjects. Increases in ethanol self-administration following institution of the reduced-feeding conditions in Phase 2 generally were inversely related to self-administration levels under the free-feeding conditions of Phase 1 (the greatest proportional increases in ethanol intake occurred with those monkeys that self-administered the least amount of ethanol in Phase 1).

The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

We report a retrospective analysis of 77 allogeneic bone marrow transplantation recipients who received simultaneous upper and lower GI tract biopsies. Upper GI GVHD was found in 44% of patients, of whom 59% also had a positive lower GI tract biopsy (P less than 0.001). Thirty-five percent of the patients with no clinical evidence of lower GI tract GVHD had symptomatic upper GI GVHD confirmed histologically. Patients with and without upper GI GVHD had no significant difference in their clinical symptoms or in their endoscopic findings. We found an association between upper GI and skin GVHD greater than stage I (P = 0.05), a trend to concordance between upper GI GVHD and clinical GVHD in the lower GI tract (P = 0.08), and with the overall clinical GVHD grade (P = 0.08) but no association with clinical liver involvement. Of these 77 patients, 16% had their treatment for acute GVHD changed to include systemic immunosuppression as a result of the upper GI endoscopic biopsy. In addition, 71% had other enteric pathology identified that required specific therapy. These data suggest that upper GI GVHD cannot be diagnosed accurately from its clinical presentation nor inferred from lower GI symptoms or from extraintestinal GVHD. Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy is an important tool in the diagnosis of intestinal GVHD."

The observed reflection is modeled using the reflectivity series derived from the salinity and temperature profiles from a nearby Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) location. Sensitivity analysis of temperature and salinity on soundspeed shows that the effect of salinity cannot be ignored for modeling acoustic reflections. The synthetic seismogram matches well with the observed reflection seismic data. Remarkable similarities between the reflection seismic and the salinity profile in the upper thermocline suggest the importance of salinity variations on the water column reflection. Furthermore, impedance inversion of the reflectivity data reveals several thermohaline structures in the water column. The origin of these thermohaline structures is largely unaddressed and may be attributed to the fresh water influx coming from Himalayan and Peninsular rivers or due to the presence of different water masses in the Indian Ocean which warrants a detailed study using concurrent seismic and CTD data.

Renal function and ADH levels were normal in group II. In groups III and IV water diuresis and fractional proximal sodium excretion were significantly decreased, whereas fractional distal sodium resorption and fractional excretion of potassium did not differ from those of controls. Basal ADH was significantly increased only in patients of group IV. In these patients ADH remained abnormally high after water loading. ADH did not correlate with water diuresis, plasma osmolality, mean arterial pressure, and plasma renin activity. We conclude that impaired water excretion in decompensated cirrhotics without hyponatremia cannot be ascribed to high serum levels of ADH. On the contrary, it seems to be related mainly to a reduced delivery of filtrate to the diluting segment of the nephron. In cirrhotic patients with hyponatremia high levels of ADH may play an additional role."

In this work, atomic force microscopy measurements of the surface mechanical properties of isolated plant cutin have been made as a first step to probing the impact of water uptake from the environment on surface flexibility. A dramatic decrease in surface elastic modulus (from approximately 32 to approximately 6 MPa) accompanies increases in water content as small as 2 wt %.

Q(B) accepts electrons from the primary quinone, Q(A), in two sequential electron transfer reactions coupled to uptake of a proton from solution. It has been suggested that water molecules along the proton uptake pathway are protonated upon quinone reduction on the basis of FTIR difference spectra [Breton, J., and Nabedryk, E. (1998) Photosynth. Res. 55, 301-307]. We examined the possible involvement of water molecules in the photoreaction processes by studying (18)O water isotope effects on FTIR difference spectra resulting from formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-). Continuum bands in D(2)O due to Q(B)(-) formation in the 2300-1800 cm(-1) region did not show spectral shifts by (18)O water in the wild-type (WT) RC, suggesting that these bands do not originate from (protonated) water. In contrast, the Q(B)(-)/Q(B) spectrum of the EQ-L212 mutant RC showed a spectral shift of a band near 2100 cm(-1) due to (18)O water substitution, consistent with protonation of internal water. FTIR shifts due to (18)O water were also observed following formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-) in the spectral region of 3700-3500 cm(-1) characteristic of weakly hydrogen bonded water. The water responsible for the Q(B)(-) change was localized near Glu-L212 by spectral shifts in mutant RCs. The weakly hydrogen bonded water perturbed by quinone reduction may play a role in stabilizing the charge-separated state."

High-quality exogenous surfactant replacement studies and studies on surfactant metabolism are available; however, the contribution of surfactant deficiency, alteration or dysfunction in selected neonatal lung conditions is not fully understood. In this article, we describe a series of studies made by applying stable isotope tracers to the study of surfactant metabolism and lung water. In a first set of studies, which we call 'endogenous studies', using stable isotope-labelled intravenous surfactant precursors, we showed the feasibility of measuring surfactant synthesis and kinetics in infants using several metabolic precursors including plasma glucose, plasma fatty acids and body water. In a second set of studies, named 'exogenous studies', using stable isotope-labelled phosphatidylcholine tracer given endotracheally, we could estimate surfactant disaturated phosphatidylcholine pool size and half-life. Very recent studies are focusing on lung water and on the endogenous biosynthesis of the surfactant-specific proteins. Information obtained from these studies in infants will help to better tailor exogenous surfactant treatment in neonatal lung diseases."

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

In this paper we quantify these downstream effects by applying the empirical U.S. Geological Survey water-quality model SPARROW to investigate whether spatial differences in conservation intensity were statistically correlated with variations in nutrient loads. In contrast to other forms of water quality data analysis, the application of SPARROW controls for confounding factors such as hydrologic variability, multiple sources and environmental processes. A measure of conservation intensity was derived from the USDA-CEAP regional assessment of the Upper Mississippi River and used as an explanatory variable in a model of the Upper Midwest. The spatial pattern of conservation intensity was negatively correlated (p = 0.003) with the total nitrogen loads in streams in the basin. Total phosphorus loads were weakly negatively correlated with conservation (p = 0.25). Regional nitrogen reductions were estimated to range from 5 to 34% and phosphorus reductions from 1 to 10% in major river basins of the Upper Mississippi region. The statistical associations between conservation and nutrient loads are consistent with hydrological and biogeochemical processes such as denitrification. The results provide empirical evidence at the regional scale that conservation practices have had a larger statistically detectable effect on nitrogen than on phosphorus loadings in streams and rivers of the Upper Mississippi Basin.

Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose modified intralumenal viscosity, with a linear relationship existing between input and lumenal viscosity. With regard to transit, the lag time before the onset of chyme recovery increased linearly as a function of luminal viscosity. There was also a pronounced decrease in the first-order emptying rate constant as lumenal viscosity increased from water to low-viscosity hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, but as viscosity was further increased there was little additional change. These results indicate that water-soluble fibers can exert a significant influence on both the lumenal viscosity and the transit profile in the upper gastrointestinal tract."

Tritium levels in the drinking water supply decrease with the distance from the dam; while in wells, springs and personal wells they are constant all along the river. The observed phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the river bed of the Techa is situated at a break zone of the earth crust, where the contaminated deep water penetrates from the reservoirs of the \"Mayak\" enterprise situated in the upper part of the regulated river bed.

However, recently these concepts were introduced in turnover models acting on the production or loss of response, respectively, even for simple (nontolerant) systems. In the latter case, the physiological limit kicks in when the state variable (response) approaches either a lower or an upper limit, not before. In this paper we propose a new approach with either one (lower or upper) limit or two (simultaneously acting lower and upper) limits (dual limits). We present an analytical mathematical treatment as well as a numerical treatment via model simulations. This approach allows for a baseline value to be only weakly dependent on the lower/upper physiological limit. It also allows dual limits, one below and one above, which is attractive because it may be applicable to commonly studied physiological and biochemical systems such as turnover of water or fat."

However, the authors present a case study of seismic data from Krishna-Godavari Basin which shows that salinity variations also play an important role in the occurrence of water column reflections. The observed reflection is modeled using the reflectivity series derived from the salinity and temperature profiles from a nearby Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) location. Sensitivity analysis of temperature and salinity on soundspeed shows that the effect of salinity cannot be ignored for modeling acoustic reflections. The synthetic seismogram matches well with the observed reflection seismic data. Remarkable similarities between the reflection seismic and the salinity profile in the upper thermocline suggest the importance of salinity variations on the water column reflection. Furthermore, impedance inversion of the reflectivity data reveals several thermohaline structures in the water column. The origin of these thermohaline structures is largely unaddressed and may be attributed to the fresh water influx coming from Himalayan and Peninsular rivers or due to the presence of different water masses in the Indian Ocean which warrants a detailed study using concurrent seismic and CTD data.

We show that the selectivity is dependent, in part, on the solvation in the cavity (sometimes referred to as the vestibule, it is the region containing water molecules between the intracellular gate and the selectivity filter at the extracellular end of the pore). We have shown earlier that potassium is more dependent at the upper end of the cavity region on solvation by the threonines there, while sodium ion has more water molecules as ligands. In addition, sodium ion is placed asymmetrically, while potassium is nearly exactly symmetric with respect to the four-fold symmetry of the channel. We have now extended these calculations to rubidium and cesium ions, and find that rubidium solvation resembles that of potassium (and both are permeant ions), while cesium resembles sodium (and both are non-permeant), in terms of the geometry of up to eight hydrating, and four non-hydrating, water molecules. In each case, a maximum of 12 water molecules are relevant to the calculation. The placement of the water molecules in the two cases is essentially the same as found from the electron density in the X-ray structure of Zhou and MacKinnon. For Na(+) and K(+), we show that energy decreases from bulk to the cavity to the lowest position in the selectivity filter (accurate energy could not be calculated for the heavier ions). A separate calculation shows that fixing the Na(+) ion at the position of the K(+) minimum, followed by re-optimization produced a significantly modified system, not something that could be produced by thermal fluctuations. Moving the K(+) into the Na(+) position in the upper cavity led to a small increase in energy, approximately 3 k(B)T, but was accompanied by large shifts in the positions of hydrating waters, which would create a major kinetic barrier. Therefore, thermal fluctuations could not invalidate the conclusions of the main calculations."

Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

Although the influence of in-season weather trends on the yields of crops such as soybean, wheat and maize has been explored in several countries(2-6), the potentially confounding influence of genetic improvements on yields has been overlooked. Here we assess the effect of in-season weather trends on soybean yields in the United States between 1994 and 2013, using field trial data, meteorological data and information on crop management practices, including the adoption of new cultivars. We show that in-season temperature trends had a greater impact on soybean yields than in-season precipitation trends over the measurement period. Averaging across the United States, we show that soybean yields fell by around 2.4% for every 1\u2005\u00b0C rise in growing season temperature. However, the response varied significantly among individual states, ranging from -22% to +9%, and also with the month of the year in which the warming occurred. We estimate that year-to-year changes in precipitation and temperature combined suppressed the US average yield gain by around 30% over the measurement period, leading to a loss of US$11 billion.

The international community has committed to reducing by half the proportion of the world's population lacking access to water and sanitation as a part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, the disease burden due to poor access, is borne primarily by the poorest countries and the poorest people within them. Simply reducing the proportion of people without adequate access will not automatically result in proportional reductions in the related disease burden. The public health challenge inherent in meeting the MDG targets is ensuring that improvements result in access to water and sanitation for the critical at-risk populations.

The system provides easy access for the patient who needs a continuous supply of medication or repeated blood sampling. To ensure no obstruction of flow, the system must be flushed to clear the port and catheter, making it important to establish the clearance parameters. These parameters can be obtained by use of a tetrapolar impedance cell to monitor the relative impedance change using two solutions of different impedances to fill and flush the system. The resulting impedance dilution curve allows calculation of time delay, dilution time, clearance time, and clearance volume. This method and resulting data may be used to characterize a portal vascular access system and provide a basis for comparative analysis of newly introduced systems."

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

Using Monte Carlo simulations, the median and 95% percentile (i.e. worst case) of total microbial load from wastewater treatment plants, sewer network overflows and emergency discharges were assessed and presented for dry and wet weather conditions. Wastewater treatment plants with secondary treatment represented a major source of E. coli, norovirus, Giardia and Cryptosporidium. During wet weather, comparably high microbial loads were found for sewer overflows due to heavy rains. Substantial loads were also associated with an incident of the emergency discharge of untreated wastewater. Simulated river water concentrations of faecal indicators (E. coli, sulfite reducing clostridia, somatic coliphages) and pathogens (norovirus, Giardia, Cryptosporidium) were confirmed by river sampling data, suggesting that urban wastewater is the major microbial source for this river."

Thirty adult mares and geldings were deprived of access to feed and water for 6 h, blocked by age, sex, breed, and body condition score, and assigned to one of the following treatments: penned, offered water (Penned/Watered, n = 5); penned, no water (Penned, n = 5); transported, offered water (Transported/Watered, two groups of n = 5); or transported, no water (Transported, two groups of n = 5). None of the horses had access to feed while on treatment. A commercial, single-deck, open-top, 15.8-m-long trailer was divided into four compartments to accommodate the two Transported/Watered and two Transported groups at 1.77 m2 per horse. At 8, 17, 22, 27, 30, and 33 h after initiation of transport, the truck returned and stopped for 1 h to allow for data collection and to give the Transported/Watered and Penned/Watered horses 10 min of access to water in individual buckets. Treatments for the non-watered horses (Penned and Transported) were terminated after 30 h due to dehydration and fatigue, whereas the watered horses (Penned/Watered and Transported/Watered) could continue for another 2 h. Mean weight loss after 30 h was greater in the Penned (57.1 kg, 12.8%) and Transported (52.2 kg, 10.3%) groups than in the Transported/Watered (20.7 kg, 4.0%) and Penned/Watered (17 kg, 3.5%) groups (P < 0.0001). Respiration, heart rate, sodium, chloride, total protein, and osmolality were significantly elevated in the non-watered horses (P < 0.0001), and sodium, chloride, total protein, and osmolality greatly exceeded normal reference ranges, indicating severe dehydration. Although not statistically significant, the horses penned in full sun, with or without water, had a dehydration response that was slightly greater than that of the transported horses. Plasma cortisol concentrations had a significant time x treatment interaction (P < 0.0001), in which the Penned/Watered and Transported/Watered horses remained relatively consistent, whereas the Transported, and especially the Penned, horses' plasma cortisol concentrations greatly increased. Transporting healthy horses for more than 24 h during hot weather and without water will cause severe dehydration; transport for more than 28 h even with periodic access to water will likely be harmful due to increasing fatigue."

Ponkan (Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Ponkan) is one of the major citrus cultivars grew in China, and the fruit are picked before fully mature to avoid bad weather. Greenhouse production is widely used to prolong the maturation period and improve the quality of Ponkan fruit by maintaining adequate temperature and providing protection from adverse weather. In this research, Ponkan fruit cultivated in either a greenhouse or open field were used to investigate differences in the expression of genes related to citrate metabolism during maturation in the two environments. The citrate contents were higher in open field fruit, and were mainly correlated with expressions of CitPEPCs, CitCSs, CitAco3 and CitGAD4, which were significantly increased. In addition, the impacts of low temperature (LT) and water stress (WS) on citrate metabolism in Ponkan were investigated during fruit maturation. The citrate contents in LT fruit were significantly increased, by between 1.4-1.9 fold, compared to the control; it showed no significant difference in fruit with water stress treatment compared to the control fruit. Furthermore, the expressions of CitPEPCs, CitCSs, CitAco3 and CitGAD4 were significantly increased in response to LT treatment, but showed no significant difference in WS compared to the control fruit. Thus, it can be concluded that low temperature may be the main factor influencing citrate metabolism during maturation in Ponkan fruit. "

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

In contrast, little is known about the apparent congregations of adult males in marsh areas lacking vegetative cover where they engage in behaviors thought to attract mates. Similar congregations and displays in avian and mammalian species are termed 'leks.' In order to test the hypothesis that open-area assemblages of Uca spp. are functioning as leks, we examined the sex ratios, juvenile/adult ratios, and the percentage of time that adult males spend eliciting reproductive behaviors within open and vegetated areas of marsh habitats. Moreover, to evaluate whether differences in sediment-based food resources could explain open-area aggregations, we compared substratum organic content of open and vegetated areas of marsh habitats. Substrate was also examined to determine if grain size composition varied between open and vegetated areas and might preclude the construction of breeding burrows in vegetated areas of the marsh. Three species of Uca from four marsh habitats in biogeographically distinct regions of North America were sampled including Dauphin Island, Alabama, Hunting Island, South Carolina, Saxis, Virginia, and Wallops Island, Virginia. Comparisons of male/female and juvenile/adult ratio means indicated that greater numbers of adult males occurred in open areas of all marshes. In addition, adult males allocated significantly greater time to reproductive behaviors in open rather than in vegetatively covered areas across-all biogeographic regions and among all species. Food levels (sediment organic content) in open areas were equal to or less than sediment organic contents in vegetated areas in marsh habitats at Dauphin Island and Hunting Island, the two marshes where the variable was examined. Similarly, substratum granulometry analysis revealed no significant differences between open and vegetatively covered areas of the marshes at Dauphin Island or Hunting Island that might influence choice of burrow location. Collectively, these observations support the hypothesis that lek behavior is an integral component of the reproductive repertoire in Uca spp."

The fate of 26 of the flaps used for reconstruction of defects of the floor of the mouth in 16 patients, were reviewed. All flaps, 6 uni- and 10 bilateral, were inferiorly based. Dehiscence, which occurred twice, and loss of one flap were the main complications. The indications and the technique are discussed. The nasolabial flap is a good alternative for the reconstruction of moderate defects of the floor of the mouth, especially in older patients and even after high doses of preoperative radiotherapy."

For each subject, the displacement of the lower interincisal point, the path of the condylar reference point, the degree of rotation around the three orthogonal rotational axes, and the relative contribution of translation and rotation were calculated during all movement of mouth opening and closing. The distance covered by the interincisor point and the rotational angle about the transverse axis at maximum mouth opening were larger in men than in women, but the difference cancelled after correcting for mandibular radius in the sagittal plane; mandibular rotation was always larger than translation, but never approaching 100%; opening and closing translations were similar within sex, but their paths were longer in men than in women (P < 0.05); rotational angles around vertical and sagittal axes were negligible; the linear correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was minor and not significant. In normal subjects, mouth opening and closing as modeled at the interincisor point was determined more by mandibular rotation than by translation, but in no occasion a pure rotation was found. The percentage rotation was not identical during mouth opening and closing; female and male paths were not totally coincident; no correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was found."

Closely placed tissue spheroids undergo tissue fusion - a process that represents a fundamental biological and biophysical principle of developmental biology-inspired directed tissue self-assembly. It is possible to engineer small segments of an intraorgan branched vascular tree by using solid and lumenized vascular tissue spheroids. Organ printing could dramatically enhance and transform the field of tissue engineering by enabling large-scale industrial robotic biofabrication of living human organ constructs with \"built-in\" perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree.

Porous scaffolds were readily fabricated by simply adjusting the printer infill density; superficial structures of the polymerized soybean oil epoxidized acrylate were significantly affected by laser frequency and printing speed. Shape memory tests confirmed that the scaffold fixed a temporary shape at -18\u2009\u00b0C and fully recovered its original shape at human body temperature (37\u2009\u00b0C), which indicated the great potential for 4D printing applications. Cytotoxicity analysis proved that the printed scaffolds had significant higher hMSC adhesion and proliferation than traditional polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), and had no statistical difference from poly lactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL). This research is believed to significantly advance the development of biomedical scaffolds with renewable plant oils and advanced 3D fabrication techniques. "

The major aspect of bioreactor landfill operation is the recirculation of collected leachate back through the refuse mass. Due to the accelerated decomposition and settlement of solid waste, bioreactor landfills are gaining popularity as an alternative to the conventional landfill. The addition or recirculation of leachate to accelerate the waste decomposition changes the geotechnical characteristics of waste mass. The daily cover soils, usually up to 20-30% of total MSW volumes in the landfill, may also influence the decomposition and shear strength behavior of MSW. The objective of this paper is to study the effects of daily covers soils on the shear strength properties of municipal solid waste (MSW) in bioreactor landfills with time and decomposition. Two sets of laboratory-scale bioreactor landfills were simulated in a laboratory, and samples were prepared to represent different phases of decomposition. The state of decomposition was quantified by methane yield, pH, and volatile organic content (VOC). Due to decomposition, the matrix structure of the degradable solid waste component was broken down and contributed to a significant decrease in the reinforcing effect of MSW. However, the daily cover soil, a non-degradable constituent of MSW, remains constant. Therefore, the interaction between daily cover soil particles and MSW particles will affect shear strength behavior. A number of triaxial tests were performed to evaluate the shear strength of MSW. The test results indicated that the shear strength of MSW was affected by the presence of cover soils. The friction angle of MSW with the presence of cover soil is higher than the friction angle of MSW without any cover soils. The friction angle of MSW increased from 27 degrees to 30 degrees due to the presence of cover soils for Phase 1 samples. The increased strength was attributed to the friction nature of sandy soil that was used as daily covers soils. Therefore, the effects of cover soils on the shear strength properties of MSW should be evaluated and taken into consideration during stability analyses and design."

Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Eye covering did not affect indoleamine levels nor locomotor activity on the regular light:dark (L:D) cycle. However, following photoperiod reversal, the eye covered chickens showed slower rates of adaptation of retinal melatonin and locomotor activity to the new L:D cycle than did the normal sighted chickens. Pineal and serum indole levels were unaffected by eye covering. Our results in birds indicate that 1) light to the eye has a role in governing retinal melatonin and locomotor activity, 2) the pineal is directly photosensitive, and 3) the endogenous rhythm of pineal melatonin may play a role in the entrainment of the locomotor rhythm in the chicken."

All randomised, controlled clinical trials comparing highly cross-linked polyethylene with conventional polyethylene were sought and then analysed by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane collaboration guidelines. Eight studies in seven articles were identified as eligible for inclusion. Due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, data from the studies included could not be pooled. No failures related to highly cross-linked polyethylene were reported. All highly cross-linked polyethylene groups had a significantly lower wear or penetration than conventional polyethylene groups. This preliminary result suggests that highly cross-linked polyethylene has significantly less wear than conventional polyethylene."

In this current study, wear predictions from laboratory and clinical studies were compared for ceramic-on-polyethylene and cobalt chrome-on-polyethylene combinations. Many laboratory studies included water-based lubrication and linear-tracking mechanisms. Now it is appreciated that these were inappropriate methods, because of a propensity for very low or virtually no polyethylene wear against ceramics in water. Thus, water-based studies predicting a 20- to 80-fold advantage for ceramic-on-polyethylene compared with metal-on-polyethylene clearly were in error. However, serum-based simulator studies with high protein-concentrations generally have shown greater wear with alumina-on-polyethylene than with metal-on-polyethylene. Controversy still remains over the use of such nonphysiologic protein levels. The simulator studies were just beginning to explore the role of serum protein concentrations and the influence on the various wear models. Polyethylene wear with zirconia systems was particularly affected by serum protein concentrations. In one simulator study, use of proteins in the physiologic range resulted in the alumina-on-polyethylene wear rate decreasing to approximately 50% of that of metal-on-polyethylene. In the literature, many hip design and polyethylene variations were reported which confounded the wear analysis. Overall, the clinical data supported the superior performance of ceramic-on-polyethylene systems by a factor of 1.5- to fourfold. However, the amount of supporting data was not large. This summary of laboratory and clinical data indicated that ceramic-on-polyethylene hip replacement systems offered on average a 50% wear reduction from metal-on-polyethylene systems."

Inductive plethysmography was used to measure the percent of nasal breathing, and the pressure-flow technique was used to estimate nasal area in 15 persons with severe nasal airway impairment. Mean nasal area was 0.17 cm2, and the average percent of nasal breathing was 20%. Analysis revealed a strong correlation (0.87) between nasal size and percent of nasal breathing in this selected group. Modeling studies based on the mean values from the subjects' data indicated that the model \"mouth\" would have to open 0.5 cm2 to shunt 80% of the airflow orally, an amount equivalent to the mean value of the subjects' respiratory mode. More important, the extrapolated data revealed that upper-airway resistance decreased in the model from 8.7 cm H2O/L/sec to a level of 3.2 cm H2O/L/sec, which is an average value for healthy adults. These data support the concept that the mouth acts as a variable resistor to maintain an optimal respiratory tract resistance when the nasal airway is impaired."

Ten endurance-trained men performed 2 trials, each involving a 10-min warm-up at 60% VO2max followed by a 30-min run. The run was performed on an automated treadmill that allowed the spontaneous selection of speeds without manual input. Participants were asked to run at speeds that equated to a rating of perceived exertion of 15, mouth rinsing with either a 6% CHO or taste-matched placebo (PLA) solution. In addition to recording self-selected speeds and total distance covered the authors assessed the runners' subjective feelings. The total distance covered was greater during the CHO than during the PLA trial (p < .05). Faster speeds selected during the first 5 min of exercise corresponded with enhanced feelings of pleasure when mouth rinsing with the CHO solution. Mouth rinsing with a CHO solution increased total distance covered during a self-selected 30-min run in comparison with mouth rinsing with a color- and taste-matched placebo."

The microtissues and tissue spheroids are living materials with certain measurable, evolving and potentially controllable composition, material and biological properties. Closely placed tissue spheroids undergo tissue fusion - a process that represents a fundamental biological and biophysical principle of developmental biology-inspired directed tissue self-assembly. It is possible to engineer small segments of an intraorgan branched vascular tree by using solid and lumenized vascular tissue spheroids. Organ printing could dramatically enhance and transform the field of tissue engineering by enabling large-scale industrial robotic biofabrication of living human organ constructs with \"built-in\" perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree. Thus, organ printing is a new emerging enabling technology paradigm which represents a developmental biology-inspired alternative to classic biodegradable solid scaffold-based approaches in tissue engineering."

Porous scaffolds were readily fabricated by simply adjusting the printer infill density; superficial structures of the polymerized soybean oil epoxidized acrylate were significantly affected by laser frequency and printing speed. Shape memory tests confirmed that the scaffold fixed a temporary shape at -18\u2009\u00b0C and fully recovered its original shape at human body temperature (37\u2009\u00b0C), which indicated the great potential for 4D printing applications. Cytotoxicity analysis proved that the printed scaffolds had significant higher hMSC adhesion and proliferation than traditional polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), and had no statistical difference from poly lactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL). This research is believed to significantly advance the development of biomedical scaffolds with renewable plant oils and advanced 3D fabrication techniques. "

After complete gas-chromatographic separation of the enantiomers in the first column, gas phase enantiomerization of the heart-cut fraction of one single enantiomer is performed in the second (reactor) column at increased temperature and afterwards this fraction is separated into the enantiomers in the third column. From the observed de novo enantiomeric peak areas a(j), the enantiomerization time t and the enantiomerization temperature T, the enantiomerization (inversion) barrier delta G#gas(T) is determined and from temperature-dependent experiments, the activation enthalpy delta H#gas and the activation entropy delta S#gas are obtained. Enantiomerization studies on chiral 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylaziridine by stopped-flow MDGC yielded activation parameters of nitrogen inversion in the gas phase, i.e., delta G#gas(353 K)=110.5+/-0.5 kJ mol(-1), delta H#gas=71.0+/-3.8 kJ mol(-1) and delta S#gas=-109+/-11 J mol(-1) K(-1).

The relationship of gaseous emboli release and cavitation on MHV has been a subject of debate in the literature. To study the influence of cavitation and gas content on the formation and growth of stable gas bubbles, a mock circulatory loop, which employed a Medtronic-Hall pyrolytic carbon disk valve in the mitral position, was used. A high-speed video camera allowed observation of cavitation and gas bubble release on the inflow valve surfaces as a function of cavitation intensity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, while an ultrasonic monitoring system scanned the aortic outflow tract to quantify gas bubble production by calculating the gray scale levels of the images. In the absence of cavitation, no stable gas bubbles were formed. When gas bubbles were formed, they were first seen a few milliseconds after and in the vicinity of cavitation collapse. The volume of the gas bubbles detected in the aortic track increased with both increased CO2 and increased cavitation intensity. No correlation was observed between O2 concentration and bubble volume. We conclude that cavitation is an essential precursor to stable gas bubble formation, and CO2, the most soluble blood gas, is the major component of stable gas bubbles."

One of the most widely employed strategies for assessing social skill has been role-play tests: simulated social interactions that are videotaped for subsequent behavioral coding. There has been considerable discussion of the validity of the approach in the literature, but there has not been adequate consideration of other psychometric characteristics of role-play tests. This paper examines the psychometric characteristics of a representative role-play measure: the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC). Data from 5 large schizophrenia studies that included the MASC were examined: a study of victimization in women who abuse drugs, a study of health care among people with diabetes, a study of vocational outcomes, a study of social skill among drug abusers, and a clinical trial comparing two antipsychotic medications. Data were examined in terms of five questions: (1) Can role-play scenes be rated reliably? (2) How are role-play ratings distributed across populations? (3) How many and which behaviors should be rated? (4) How many role-play scenes are required? (5) Is role-play behavior temporally stable? Overall, the data suggest that the MASC, and by implication other similar role-play procedures, does have good psychometric properties. However, several things often taken for granted in the literature warrant careful consideration in the design of research using role-play. Implications of the results for design of research are discussed."

Girls exposed to high levels of androgen prenatally, because of the genetic disorder congenital adrenal hyperplasia, show increased male-typical play, suggesting similar hormonal influences on human development, at least in females. Here, we report that fetal testosterone measured from amniotic fluid relates positively to male-typical scores on a standardized questionnaire measure of sex-typical play in both boys and girls. These results show, for the first time, a link between fetal testosterone and the development of sex-typical play in children from the general population, and are the first data linking high levels of prenatal testosterone to increased male-typical play behavior in boys."

The previous studies by the author on outdoor play interactions in Japanese families suggest that these tendencies may be an adaptation to hunter-gatherer lives. In the present study, this suggestion was investigated by examining whether (1) fathers tend to teach their sons how to fish more frequently than they teach their daughters, and (2) boys taught fishing skills by their fathers tend to have better fishing skills than other same-aged boys taught fishing skills by persons other than their fathers. The experiment was performed by obtaining information through a questionnaire from third and fifth grade students in four elementary schools. The results indicate the followings. (1) Fathers tend to teach their sons fishing more often than they tend to teach their daughters.

Eight studies in seven articles were identified as eligible for inclusion. Due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, data from the studies included could not be pooled.

In this current study, wear predictions from laboratory and clinical studies were compared for ceramic-on-polyethylene and cobalt chrome-on-polyethylene combinations. Many laboratory studies included water-based lubrication and linear-tracking mechanisms. Now it is appreciated that these were inappropriate methods, because of a propensity for very low or virtually no polyethylene wear against ceramics in water. Thus, water-based studies predicting a 20- to 80-fold advantage for ceramic-on-polyethylene compared with metal-on-polyethylene clearly were in error. However, serum-based simulator studies with high protein-concentrations generally have shown greater wear with alumina-on-polyethylene than with metal-on-polyethylene. Controversy still remains over the use of such nonphysiologic protein levels. The simulator studies were just beginning to explore the role of serum protein concentrations and the influence on the various wear models. Polyethylene wear with zirconia systems was particularly affected by serum protein concentrations. In one simulator study, use of proteins in the physiologic range resulted in the alumina-on-polyethylene wear rate decreasing to approximately 50% of that of metal-on-polyethylene. In the literature, many hip design and polyethylene variations were reported which confounded the wear analysis. Overall, the clinical data supported the superior performance of ceramic-on-polyethylene systems by a factor of 1.5- to fourfold. However, the amount of supporting data was not large. This summary of laboratory and clinical data indicated that ceramic-on-polyethylene hip replacement systems offered on average a 50% wear reduction from metal-on-polyethylene systems."

The current study was designed to compare a modern congruent all-polyethylene tibial component with a metal-backed tibial component with the same articular design and geometry. All patients older than 60 years of age requiring total knee arthroplasty were randomized prospectively to receive either a cemented posterior cruciate ligament-retaining all-polyethylene component or a metal-backed tibial component with identical articular surfaces. All patients received identical cemented femoral and all-polyethylene patellar implants. The mean age of the patients was 69 years, and the mean American Society of Anesthesiology score was 3. The diagnosis was osteoarthritis in 92% of this population. Three hundred twenty-four total knee arthroplasties in 296 patients were performed; 213 joints (111 all-polyethylene tibias and 102 metal-backed tibias) with a minimum of 3 years followup (mean, 49 months) are reported. The preoperative Knee Society knee score in the group of patients who received an all-polyethylene tibial component was 38 points, improving to 84 points at latest followup, whereas in the group of patients who received a metal-backed tibial component, the score improved from 35 to 85 points. Functional scores increased from preoperative values of 56 to 74 points in the patients who received all-polyethylene tibial components, and 57 to 72 points in the patients who received metal-backed tibial components. Range of motion measured at latest followup averaged 106 degrees in patients who received an all-polyethylene tibial component and 107 degrees in the patients who received a metal-backed component, and postoperative tibiofemoral alignment averaged 6 degrees valgus for both groups. There were 13 reoperations for instability, patellofemoral problems, or deep infection, but none for aseptic loosening or wear in either group. These differences were not statistically significant, nor were any measures of patient satisfaction or clinical outcome between the two groups in this period. Total knee arthroplasty with a well-designed, contemporary congruent all-polyethylene tibial component functions equivalently to its metal-backed tibial counterpart at 3- to 5-year followup in this patient population, and is less costly ($675)."

The meniscus repair was done by open arthrotomy in 26 cases and by arthroscopic techniques in 45 cases. We have assessed the relative efficacies of open and arthroscopic repair techniques. The results were compared in knees with and without anterior cruciate laxity. The indications for meniscal repair included unstable peripheral detachments and longitudinal tears of the outer third of the meniscus. Open repair was performed by a posteromedial arthrotomy incision. Arthroscopic repair was done using the double-lumen guide system with a limited posterior incision for retrieval of needles. We have found that the arthroscopic technique is easier to perform than the open repair because some tears are too far inside the rim to lend themselves to open suture. The average follow-up is 4 years, 2 months, with a range of 2-10 years. There have been no neurologic or vascular injuries from either technique. Twenty-five patients have had a repeat arthroscopy. The overall failure rate was 9.8%. The difference between the failure rate of 11% in the open-repair group and 8.8% in the arthroscopic repair group was not statistically significant. The failure rate in anterior cruciate-stable knees was 8% versus a 13% failure in cruciate-deficient knees. We conclude that both open and arthroscopic meniscus repair techniques are safe and effective with few complications in both stable and unstable knees. Anterior cruciate ligament stability is ideal, but it is not mandatory for a successful result."

Changes in the cup-to-disc ratio, cup volume, and ratio of rim area to disc area were not significant in eyes with cotton-wool spots. The quotient of cup volume divided by cup-to-disc ratio eyes with of primary open-angle glaucoma was greater than that in eyes with cotton-wool spots. For the detection of nerve loss in eyes with cotton-wool spots, the image analyzer, which identified the notches in the horizontally sectioned contour line of the cup, was more sensitive than stereoscopic detection of the notches in the rim (P less than 0.05). The image analyzer enabled the detection of slight nerve-fiber loss by examination of the contour line of the cup in eyes with cotton-wool spots."

Hymenal configuration and the number and location of clefts, bumps, tags, and ridges were observed in 468 neonates; photographs for confirmation were obtained for 449 neonates (96%). Hymenal configurations observed included an annular hymen with a central or ventrally displaced orifice in 80% (372/468) of neonates, a fimbriated hymen in 19% (90/468), and a septated or cribriform hymen in 1% (6/468). Configurations significantly differed by race (P less than .001) but no difference was noted by gestational age or weight. Clefts, which occurred only on the ventral 180 degrees of the rim, were observed in 34% of neonates with an annular hymen. Fifty-six percent of neonates had a longitudinal intravaginal ridge, 87% had an external hymenal ridge, and 13% had a tag extending from the rim or a ridge. Periurethral ligaments were frequently observed. It is concluded that lateral and ventral clefts, intravaginal and external ridges, and periurethral bands are normal anatomical findings in the newborn."

Closely placed tissue spheroids undergo tissue fusion - a process that represents a fundamental biological and biophysical principle of developmental biology-inspired directed tissue self-assembly. It is possible to engineer small segments of an intraorgan branched vascular tree by using solid and lumenized vascular tissue spheroids. Organ printing could dramatically enhance and transform the field of tissue engineering by enabling large-scale industrial robotic biofabrication of living human organ constructs with \"built-in\" perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree. Thus, organ printing is a new emerging enabling technology paradigm which represents a developmental biology-inspired alternative to classic biodegradable solid scaffold-based approaches in tissue engineering."

Here we solidified a novel renewable soybean oil epoxidized acrylate, using a 3D laser printing technique, into smart and highly biocompatible scaffolds capable of supporting growth of multipotent human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Porous scaffolds were readily fabricated by simply adjusting the printer infill density; superficial structures of the polymerized soybean oil epoxidized acrylate were significantly affected by laser frequency and printing speed. Shape memory tests confirmed that the scaffold fixed a temporary shape at -18\u2009\u00b0C and fully recovered its original shape at human body temperature (37\u2009\u00b0C), which indicated the great potential for 4D printing applications. Cytotoxicity analysis proved that the printed scaffolds had significant higher hMSC adhesion and proliferation than traditional polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), and had no statistical difference from poly lactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL).

During procedures with poor access to the patient's airway, it may not be possible to use a self-inflating mechanical ventilation device (SIMVD) for emergency ventilation, and alternative solutions are needed. We evaluated five methods for rescue ventilation using a patient simulator. In Method 1, we used the inspiratory and expiratory tubes and the alternative common gas outlet (ACGO) on the anaesthesia machine to produce a Mapleson E system. In Method 2, we used the tubes, ACGO and an open-ended reservoir bag to produce a Mapleson F system, controlling the bag to achieve ventilation. In Method 3, we attached a SIMVD to the inspiratory tube, and controlled occlusion of the expiratory tube. In Method 4, we used the tubes and ACGO in a Mapleson F configuration, replacing the open-ended bag with a SIMVD to facilitate manual ventilation. In Method 5, we attached a SIMVD to the expiratory tube and left the inspiratory tube attached to its mounting. We were able to achieve ventilation, maintain inhalational anaesthesia, and prevent expired gas rebreathing in Methods 1 and 2. In Method 3 ventilation was achieved with minimal rebreathing of expiratory gas, but with no inhalational agent. Methods 4 and 5 led to rebreathing. Our findings indicate that Methods 1 or 2 are the preferred rapid solutions to maintain ventilation and inhalational anaesthesia in the event of anaesthesia machine failure where there is poor airway access.

The ability of the same EDG to produce different eluents is governed solely by the choice of the respective feed solutions; this is presently demonstrated by generation of diverse eluents such as Na(2)CO(3)/NaHCO(3), CH(3)SO(3)H, and KNO(3). The EDG is implemented simply in a commercial cross fitting and has been tested up pressures to 2000psi. Under typical operating conditions, the zero current concentration (open circuit penetration, OCP) is negligible. The generated eluent concentration linearly increases with applied current with a slope that is essentially Faradaic.

Results demonstrate that retention factor and column efficiency are the main factors affecting peak capacity for fast separations. Packed columns produce both high retention factors and high selectivities. While high efficiencies and high peak capacities can be demonstrated by both techniques, open tubular column GC can surpass packed capillary column SGC in both measurements, except for the case of the analysis of simple mixtures in short analysis times, where retention factor and selectivity become important. Practical aspects such as pressure drop and sample capacity are compared for SGC and open tubular column GC. It was found that packed column SGC demonstrates higher sample capacities, but requires much higher column inlet pressures than open tubular column GC.

In this current study, wear predictions from laboratory and clinical studies were compared for ceramic-on-polyethylene and cobalt chrome-on-polyethylene combinations. Many laboratory studies included water-based lubrication and linear-tracking mechanisms. Now it is appreciated that these were inappropriate methods, because of a propensity for very low or virtually no polyethylene wear against ceramics in water. Thus, water-based studies predicting a 20- to 80-fold advantage for ceramic-on-polyethylene compared with metal-on-polyethylene clearly were in error. However, serum-based simulator studies with high protein-concentrations generally have shown greater wear with alumina-on-polyethylene than with metal-on-polyethylene. Controversy still remains over the use of such nonphysiologic protein levels. The simulator studies were just beginning to explore the role of serum protein concentrations and the influence on the various wear models. Polyethylene wear with zirconia systems was particularly affected by serum protein concentrations. In one simulator study, use of proteins in the physiologic range resulted in the alumina-on-polyethylene wear rate decreasing to approximately 50% of that of metal-on-polyethylene. In the literature, many hip design and polyethylene variations were reported which confounded the wear analysis. Overall, the clinical data supported the superior performance of ceramic-on-polyethylene systems by a factor of 1.5- to fourfold. However, the amount of supporting data was not large. This summary of laboratory and clinical data indicated that ceramic-on-polyethylene hip replacement systems offered on average a 50% wear reduction from metal-on-polyethylene systems."

Mechanisms of wear of the polyethylene cup have been presented. It has been inferred that the process of loosening of the polyethylene cup is a combination of plastic deformation, tribologic wear, fracture and changes of the polyethylene structure. All these occurrences are connected with reaction of bone tissue to stress and polyethylene debris."

The meniscus repair was done by open arthrotomy in 26 cases and by arthroscopic techniques in 45 cases. We have assessed the relative efficacies of open and arthroscopic repair techniques. The results were compared in knees with and without anterior cruciate laxity. The indications for meniscal repair included unstable peripheral detachments and longitudinal tears of the outer third of the meniscus. Open repair was performed by a posteromedial arthrotomy incision. Arthroscopic repair was done using the double-lumen guide system with a limited posterior incision for retrieval of needles. We have found that the arthroscopic technique is easier to perform than the open repair because some tears are too far inside the rim to lend themselves to open suture. The average follow-up is 4 years, 2 months, with a range of 2-10 years. There have been no neurologic or vascular injuries from either technique. Twenty-five patients have had a repeat arthroscopy. The overall failure rate was 9.8%. The difference between the failure rate of 11% in the open-repair group and 8.8% in the arthroscopic repair group was not statistically significant. The failure rate in anterior cruciate-stable knees was 8% versus a 13% failure in cruciate-deficient knees. We conclude that both open and arthroscopic meniscus repair techniques are safe and effective with few complications in both stable and unstable knees. Anterior cruciate ligament stability is ideal, but it is not mandatory for a successful result."

Shape memory tests confirmed that the scaffold fixed a temporary shape at -18\u2009\u00b0C and fully recovered its original shape at human body temperature (37\u2009\u00b0C), which indicated the great potential for 4D printing applications.

Results demonstrate that retention factor and column efficiency are the main factors affecting peak capacity for fast separations. Packed columns produce both high retention factors and high selectivities. While high efficiencies and high peak capacities can be demonstrated by both techniques, open tubular column GC can surpass packed capillary column SGC in both measurements, except for the case of the analysis of simple mixtures in short analysis times, where retention factor and selectivity become important. Practical aspects such as pressure drop and sample capacity are compared for SGC and open tubular column GC. It was found that packed column SGC demonstrates higher sample capacities, but requires much higher column inlet pressures than open tubular column GC.

Computer control of CCA has been proposed to facilitate its use. Past efforts have either been limited to the control of anesthetic gas concentrations or apply only to a small group of patients. This paper describes a comprehensive control system applicable to a large class of patients. This system controls the end-tidal oxygen and anesthetic gas concentrations, and the circuit volume. The CCA process was modeled by writing mass balance equations. Simplifying assumptions yielded a bilinear single-input-single-output model for the anesthetic gas concentration and a bilinear multiple-input-multiple-output model for the circuit volume and oxygen concentration. One-step-ahead controllers were used to control these two subsystems. Simulations showed that the control performance was most sensitive to the gas uptakes. Three independent, least-mean-squares estimation schemes were implemented to estimate the uptakes of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and anesthetic gas. These estimates were used in the control law and resulted in explicit adaptive control. The performance of the adaptive controller was compared to that of a fixed controller (with precalculated gas uptakes) in five animal experiments. The adaptive controller performed better than the fixed controller in all cases. The most significant difference was in the anesthetic gas response time 3.6 +/- 0.70 min for adaptive control and 7.04 +/- 5.62 min for fixed control. The adaptive controller was also robust with respect to variations in the system parameters such as the functional residual capacity, leak, deadspace and gas uptakes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

During procedures with poor access to the patient's airway, it may not be possible to use a self-inflating mechanical ventilation device (SIMVD) for emergency ventilation, and alternative solutions are needed. We evaluated five methods for rescue ventilation using a patient simulator. In Method 1, we used the inspiratory and expiratory tubes and the alternative common gas outlet (ACGO) on the anaesthesia machine to produce a Mapleson E system. In Method 2, we used the tubes, ACGO and an open-ended reservoir bag to produce a Mapleson F system, controlling the bag to achieve ventilation. In Method 3, we attached a SIMVD to the inspiratory tube, and controlled occlusion of the expiratory tube. In Method 4, we used the tubes and ACGO in a Mapleson F configuration, replacing the open-ended bag with a SIMVD to facilitate manual ventilation. In Method 5, we attached a SIMVD to the expiratory tube and left the inspiratory tube attached to its mounting. We were able to achieve ventilation, maintain inhalational anaesthesia, and prevent expired gas rebreathing in Methods 1 and 2. In Method 3 ventilation was achieved with minimal rebreathing of expiratory gas, but with no inhalational agent. Methods 4 and 5 led to rebreathing. Our findings indicate that Methods 1 or 2 are the preferred rapid solutions to maintain ventilation and inhalational anaesthesia in the event of anaesthesia machine failure where there is poor airway access.

In addition to recording self-selected speeds and total distance covered the authors assessed the runners' subjective feelings. The total distance covered was greater during the CHO than during the PLA trial (p < .05).

In this current study, wear predictions from laboratory and clinical studies were compared for ceramic-on-polyethylene and cobalt chrome-on-polyethylene combinations. Many laboratory studies included water-based lubrication and linear-tracking mechanisms. Now it is appreciated that these were inappropriate methods, because of a propensity for very low or virtually no polyethylene wear against ceramics in water. Thus, water-based studies predicting a 20- to 80-fold advantage for ceramic-on-polyethylene compared with metal-on-polyethylene clearly were in error. However, serum-based simulator studies with high protein-concentrations generally have shown greater wear with alumina-on-polyethylene than with metal-on-polyethylene. Controversy still remains over the use of such nonphysiologic protein levels. The simulator studies were just beginning to explore the role of serum protein concentrations and the influence on the various wear models. Polyethylene wear with zirconia systems was particularly affected by serum protein concentrations. In one simulator study, use of proteins in the physiologic range resulted in the alumina-on-polyethylene wear rate decreasing to approximately 50% of that of metal-on-polyethylene. In the literature, many hip design and polyethylene variations were reported which confounded the wear analysis. Overall, the clinical data supported the superior performance of ceramic-on-polyethylene systems by a factor of 1.5- to fourfold. However, the amount of supporting data was not large. This summary of laboratory and clinical data indicated that ceramic-on-polyethylene hip replacement systems offered on average a 50% wear reduction from metal-on-polyethylene systems."

The current study was designed to compare a modern congruent all-polyethylene tibial component with a metal-backed tibial component with the same articular design and geometry. All patients older than 60 years of age requiring total knee arthroplasty were randomized prospectively to receive either a cemented posterior cruciate ligament-retaining all-polyethylene component or a metal-backed tibial component with identical articular surfaces. All patients received identical cemented femoral and all-polyethylene patellar implants. The mean age of the patients was 69 years, and the mean American Society of Anesthesiology score was 3. The diagnosis was osteoarthritis in 92% of this population. Three hundred twenty-four total knee arthroplasties in 296 patients were performed; 213 joints (111 all-polyethylene tibias and 102 metal-backed tibias) with a minimum of 3 years followup (mean, 49 months) are reported. The preoperative Knee Society knee score in the group of patients who received an all-polyethylene tibial component was 38 points, improving to 84 points at latest followup, whereas in the group of patients who received a metal-backed tibial component, the score improved from 35 to 85 points. Functional scores increased from preoperative values of 56 to 74 points in the patients who received all-polyethylene tibial components, and 57 to 72 points in the patients who received metal-backed tibial components. Range of motion measured at latest followup averaged 106 degrees in patients who received an all-polyethylene tibial component and 107 degrees in the patients who received a metal-backed component, and postoperative tibiofemoral alignment averaged 6 degrees valgus for both groups. There were 13 reoperations for instability, patellofemoral problems, or deep infection, but none for aseptic loosening or wear in either group. These differences were not statistically significant, nor were any measures of patient satisfaction or clinical outcome between the two groups in this period. Total knee arthroplasty with a well-designed, contemporary congruent all-polyethylene tibial component functions equivalently to its metal-backed tibial counterpart at 3- to 5-year followup in this patient population, and is less costly ($675)."

Eight studies in seven articles were identified as eligible for inclusion. Due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, data from the studies included could not be pooled.

In this current study, wear predictions from laboratory and clinical studies were compared for ceramic-on-polyethylene and cobalt chrome-on-polyethylene combinations. Many laboratory studies included water-based lubrication and linear-tracking mechanisms. Now it is appreciated that these were inappropriate methods, because of a propensity for very low or virtually no polyethylene wear against ceramics in water. Thus, water-based studies predicting a 20- to 80-fold advantage for ceramic-on-polyethylene compared with metal-on-polyethylene clearly were in error. However, serum-based simulator studies with high protein-concentrations generally have shown greater wear with alumina-on-polyethylene than with metal-on-polyethylene. Controversy still remains over the use of such nonphysiologic protein levels. The simulator studies were just beginning to explore the role of serum protein concentrations and the influence on the various wear models. Polyethylene wear with zirconia systems was particularly affected by serum protein concentrations. In one simulator study, use of proteins in the physiologic range resulted in the alumina-on-polyethylene wear rate decreasing to approximately 50% of that of metal-on-polyethylene. In the literature, many hip design and polyethylene variations were reported which confounded the wear analysis. Overall, the clinical data supported the superior performance of ceramic-on-polyethylene systems by a factor of 1.5- to fourfold. However, the amount of supporting data was not large. This summary of laboratory and clinical data indicated that ceramic-on-polyethylene hip replacement systems offered on average a 50% wear reduction from metal-on-polyethylene systems."

Closely placed tissue spheroids undergo tissue fusion - a process that represents a fundamental biological and biophysical principle of developmental biology-inspired directed tissue self-assembly. It is possible to engineer small segments of an intraorgan branched vascular tree by using solid and lumenized vascular tissue spheroids. Organ printing could dramatically enhance and transform the field of tissue engineering by enabling large-scale industrial robotic biofabrication of living human organ constructs with \"built-in\" perfusable intraorgan branched vascular tree. Thus, organ printing is a new emerging enabling technology paradigm which represents a developmental biology-inspired alternative to classic biodegradable solid scaffold-based approaches in tissue engineering."

Porous scaffolds were readily fabricated by simply adjusting the printer infill density; superficial structures of the polymerized soybean oil epoxidized acrylate were significantly affected by laser frequency and printing speed. Shape memory tests confirmed that the scaffold fixed a temporary shape at -18\u2009\u00b0C and fully recovered its original shape at human body temperature (37\u2009\u00b0C), which indicated the great potential for 4D printing applications. Cytotoxicity analysis proved that the printed scaffolds had significant higher hMSC adhesion and proliferation than traditional polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), and had no statistical difference from poly lactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL). This research is believed to significantly advance the development of biomedical scaffolds with renewable plant oils and advanced 3D fabrication techniques. "

The example of electronic applications depicts the feasibility of cilia for 'stick-&-play' systems, which provide electronic functions by transfer printing on unconventional complex surfaces. "

Over the years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the regulation of GA signalling and metabolism, which ensures appropriate levels of GAs for growth and development(2). Moreover, an additional level of regulation may reside in the transport of GAs from production sites to recipient tissues that require GAs for growth. Although there is considerable evidence suggesting the existence of short- and long-distance movement of GAs in plants(3-8), the nature and the biological properties of this transport are not yet understood. Here, we combine biochemical and conventional micrografting experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana to show that the GA precursor GA12, although biologically inactive by itself, is the major mobile GA signal over long distances. Quantitative analysis of endogenous GAs in xylem and phloem exudates further indicates that GA12 moves through the plant vascular system. Finally, we demonstrate that GA12 is functional in recipient tissues, supporting growth via the activation of the GA signalling cascade. Collectively, these results reveal the existence of long-range transport of endogenous GA12 in plants that may have implications for the control of developmental phase transitions and the adaptation to adverse environments.

After complete gas-chromatographic separation of the enantiomers in the first column, gas phase enantiomerization of the heart-cut fraction of one single enantiomer is performed in the second (reactor) column at increased temperature and afterwards this fraction is separated into the enantiomers in the third column. From the observed de novo enantiomeric peak areas a(j), the enantiomerization time t and the enantiomerization temperature T, the enantiomerization (inversion) barrier delta G#gas(T) is determined and from temperature-dependent experiments, the activation enthalpy delta H#gas and the activation entropy delta S#gas are obtained. Enantiomerization studies on chiral 1-chloro-2,2-dimethylaziridine by stopped-flow MDGC yielded activation parameters of nitrogen inversion in the gas phase, i.e., delta G#gas(353 K)=110.5+/-0.5 kJ mol(-1), delta H#gas=71.0+/-3.8 kJ mol(-1) and delta S#gas=-109+/-11 J mol(-1) K(-1).

To study the influence of cavitation and gas content on the formation and growth of stable gas bubbles, a mock circulatory loop, which employed a Medtronic-Hall pyrolytic carbon disk valve in the mitral position, was used. A high-speed video camera allowed observation of cavitation and gas bubble release on the inflow valve surfaces as a function of cavitation intensity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, while an ultrasonic monitoring system scanned the aortic outflow tract to quantify gas bubble production by calculating the gray scale levels of the images. In the absence of cavitation, no stable gas bubbles were formed. When gas bubbles were formed, they were first seen a few milliseconds after and in the vicinity of cavitation collapse. The volume of the gas bubbles detected in the aortic track increased with both increased CO2 and increased cavitation intensity. No correlation was observed between O2 concentration and bubble volume. We conclude that cavitation is an essential precursor to stable gas bubble formation, and CO2, the most soluble blood gas, is the major component of stable gas bubbles."

In MVP chest wall compliance and airway pressure probably play major roles on the response to PLEF drainage. PLEF reduces inspiratory muscle efficiency; hence drainage can help in weaning.

Chemical analysis of tank-mixed solutions sampled at 0, 24, 48, 72, 168 and 336 h indicated that fipronil remained stable. Our data indicated that polyethylene tanks prevent fipronil from photodegradation and these tanks can be safely used for short term storage (up to 2 week) of liquid termiticides."

The current study was designed to compare a modern congruent all-polyethylene tibial component with a metal-backed tibial component with the same articular design and geometry. All patients older than 60 years of age requiring total knee arthroplasty were randomized prospectively to receive either a cemented posterior cruciate ligament-retaining all-polyethylene component or a metal-backed tibial component with identical articular surfaces. All patients received identical cemented femoral and all-polyethylene patellar implants. The mean age of the patients was 69 years, and the mean American Society of Anesthesiology score was 3. The diagnosis was osteoarthritis in 92% of this population. Three hundred twenty-four total knee arthroplasties in 296 patients were performed; 213 joints (111 all-polyethylene tibias and 102 metal-backed tibias) with a minimum of 3 years followup (mean, 49 months) are reported. The preoperative Knee Society knee score in the group of patients who received an all-polyethylene tibial component was 38 points, improving to 84 points at latest followup, whereas in the group of patients who received a metal-backed tibial component, the score improved from 35 to 85 points. Functional scores increased from preoperative values of 56 to 74 points in the patients who received all-polyethylene tibial components, and 57 to 72 points in the patients who received metal-backed tibial components. Range of motion measured at latest followup averaged 106 degrees in patients who received an all-polyethylene tibial component and 107 degrees in the patients who received a metal-backed component, and postoperative tibiofemoral alignment averaged 6 degrees valgus for both groups. There were 13 reoperations for instability, patellofemoral problems, or deep infection, but none for aseptic loosening or wear in either group. These differences were not statistically significant, nor were any measures of patient satisfaction or clinical outcome between the two groups in this period. Total knee arthroplasty with a well-designed, contemporary congruent all-polyethylene tibial component functions equivalently to its metal-backed tibial counterpart at 3- to 5-year followup in this patient population, and is less costly ($675)."

Human macrophages and osteoclasts were incubated with several ratios of fluorescent polyethylene-like nanoparticles between 1 and 72 h, and 4 h, 2, 4, 6, and 9 days, respectively. The internalization of nanoparticles was quantified by flow cytometry and followed by both confocal and video time-lapse microscopy. Osteoclast differentiation and activity was semiquantified by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, TRAP mRNA relative expression, and pit resorption assay, respectively. Macrophages, osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts internalized nanoparticles in a dose- and time-dependent manner and maintained their resorptive activity. In addition, nanoparticles significantly increased the osteoclastogenesis as shown by upregulation of the TRAP expressing cell number.

All randomised, controlled clinical trials comparing highly cross-linked polyethylene with conventional polyethylene were sought and then analysed by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane collaboration guidelines. Eight studies in seven articles were identified as eligible for inclusion. Due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, data from the studies included could not be pooled. No failures related to highly cross-linked polyethylene were reported. All highly cross-linked polyethylene groups had a significantly lower wear or penetration than conventional polyethylene groups. This preliminary result suggests that highly cross-linked polyethylene has significantly less wear than conventional polyethylene."

            "article": "The benefit of reduced polyethylene wear with ceramic in hip replacements does not seem to have been universally appreciated. In this current study, wear predictions from laboratory and clinical studies were compared for ceramic-on-polyethylene and cobalt chrome-on-polyethylene combinations. Many laboratory studies included water-based lubrication and linear-tracking mechanisms. Now it is appreciated that these were inappropriate methods, because of a propensity for very low or virtually no polyethylene wear against ceramics in water. Thus, water-based studies predicting a 20- to 80-fold advantage for ceramic-on-polyethylene compared with metal-on-polyethylene clearly were in error. However, serum-based simulator studies with high protein-concentrations generally have shown greater wear with alumina-on-polyethylene than with metal-on-polyethylene. Controversy still remains over the use of such nonphysiologic protein levels. The simulator studies were just beginning to explore the role of serum protein concentrations and the influence on the various wear models. Polyethylene wear with zirconia systems was particularly affected by serum protein concentrations. In one simulator study, use of proteins in the physiologic range resulted in the alumina-on-polyethylene wear rate decreasing to approximately 50% of that of metal-on-polyethylene. In the literature, many hip design and polyethylene variations were reported which confounded the wear analysis. Overall, the clinical data supported the superior performance of ceramic-on-polyethylene systems by a factor of 1.5- to fourfold. However, the amount of supporting data was not large. This summary of laboratory and clinical data indicated that ceramic-on-polyethylene hip replacement systems offered on average a 50% wear reduction from metal-on-polyethylene systems."

Mechanisms of wear of the polyethylene cup have been presented.

All these occurrences are connected with reaction of bone tissue to stress and polyethylene debris."
