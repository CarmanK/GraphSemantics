    "A carbon fiber reinforced metal matrix composite is produced by depositing a metal boride coating on the surface of the fibers and subsequently immersing the fibers in a molten bath of the metal matrix material.",
    "A ceramic-metal material system is fabricated by cold compressing separate adjacent volumes of different ceramic material or different particle sizes to form a porous ceramic compact; infiltrating each separate volume of the compact with a molten metal, the first separate volume of the compact being infiltrated with a metal having a higher melting point than the metal which infiltrates the second separate volume and forms an interface with the first infiltrated metal.",
    "A method for bonding aluminum and aluminum alloys to refractory materials.",
    "Carbon fibers in a carbon-fiber-reinforced metal-matrix composite having a relatively very high modulus are treated with a relatively thin amorphous carbon coating precedent to a metal-oxide film to improve the adhesion thereof to the carbon fiber thereby facilitating the wetting of carbon fibers to molten matrix metal."
