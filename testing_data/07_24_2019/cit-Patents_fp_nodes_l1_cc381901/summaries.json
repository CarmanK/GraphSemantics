    "A method of producing multifocal ophthalmic lenses having a near vision minor lens element adhesively secured to the ocular surface of a major lens is disclosed.",
    "An optical element comprising a glass substrate on which a plastics material defining an optical surface is moulded.",
    "The successful fitting of bifocal lenses presents, conventionally, difficult and expensive problems due to a variety of different and conflicting requirements which must be mutually reconciled in every compound bifocal.",
    "There is disclosed an improved method of assembling and fusing the segment and major elements of a multifocal lens blank that employs glass spacer members to space the segment from the major element and allow the segment to progressively slump into sealing relationship with the major as fusion temperature is approached."
