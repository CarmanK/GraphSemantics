["Accumulation of reduced pheophytin a (Pheo-D1) in photosystem II reaction center (PSII RC) under illumination at low redox potential is accompanied by changes in absorbance and circular dichroism spectra", " Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer", " It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite", " The nine-haem cytochrome c (9Hcc), previously described as having 12 haem groups, was isolated from cells of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774, grown under both nitrate- and sulphate-respiring conditions", " A better indicator for copper supply may be the evaluation of those food items, which are the predominant sources of copper intake at the population level"]
