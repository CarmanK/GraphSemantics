[["Role of the aromatic ring of Tyr43 in tetraheme cytochrome c(3) from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F Tyrosine 43 is positioned parallel to the fifth heme axial ligand, His34, of heme 1 in the tetraheme cytochrome c(3). The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics. The mutation of Y43L, however, did not induce a significant change in the crystal structure.", "Structural basis of drug binding to CYP46A1, an enzyme that controls cholesterol turnover in the brain. Cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) initiates the major pathway of cholesterol elimination from the brain and thereby controls cholesterol turnover in this organ. We determined x-ray crystal structures of CYP46A1 in complex with four structurally distinct pharmaceuticals; antidepressant tranylcypromine (2.15 \u00c5), anticonvulsant thioperamide (1.65 \u00c5), antifungal voriconazole (2.35 \u00c5), and antifungal clotrimazole (2.50 \u00c5). All four drugs are nitrogen-containing compounds that have nanomolar affinity for CYP46A1 in vitro yet differ in size, shape, hydrophobicity, and type of the nitrogen ligand. Structures of the co-complexes demonstrate that each drug binds in a single orientation to the active site with tranylcypromine, thioperamide, and voriconazole coordinating the heme iron via their nitrogen atoms and clotrimazole being at a 4 \u00c5 distance from the heme iron. We show here that clotrimazole is also a substrate for CYP46A1. High affinity for CYP46A1 is determined by a set of specific interactions, some of which were further investigated by solution studies using structural analogs of the drugs and the T306A CYP46A1 mutant. Collectively, our results reveal how diverse inhibitors can be accommodated in the CYP46A1 active site and provide an explanation for the observed differences in the drug-induced spectral response. Co-complexes with tranylcypromine, thioperamide, and voriconazole represent the first structural characterization of the drug binding to a P450 enzyme.", "Ligand Migration and Binding in the Dimeric Hemoglobin of Scapharca inaequivalvis Using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with temperature derivative spectroscopy (TDS) at cryogenic temperatures, we have studied CO binding to the heme and CO migration among cavities in the interior of the dimeric hemoglobin of Scapharca inaequivalvis (HbI) after photodissociation. By combining these studies with X-ray crystallography, three transient ligand docking sites were identified: a primary docking site B in close vicinity to the heme iron, and two secondary docking sites C and D corresponding to the Xe4 and Xe2 cavities of myoglobin. To assess the relevance of these findings for physiological binding, we also performed flash photolysis experiments on HbICO at room temperature and equilibrium binding studies with dioxygen. Our results show that the Xe4 and Xe2 cavities serve as transient docking sites for unbound ligands in the protein, but not as way stations on the entry/exit pathway. For HbI, the so-called histidine gate mechanism proposed for other globins appears as a plausible entry/exit route as well.", "Structure of Sr-substituted photosystem II at 2.1 A resolution and its implications in the mechanism of water oxidation Oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII) is a tetra-manganese calcium penta-oxygenic cluster (Mn4CaO5) catalyzing light-induced water oxidation through several intermediate states (S-states) by a mechanism that is not fully understood. To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure.", "The primary and three-dimensional structures of a nine-haem cytochrome c from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 reveal a new member of the Hmc family. Haem-containing proteins are directly involved in electron transfer as well as in enzymatic functions. The nine-haem cytochrome c (9Hcc), previously described as having 12 haem groups, was isolated from cells of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774, grown under both nitrate- and sulphate-respiring conditions.", "The octahaem MccA is a haem c-copper sulfite reductase. The six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide is the pivot point of the biogeochemical cycle of the element sulfur. The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA.

The crystallographic R-factor is 16.0%. The estimated error in atomic positions is 0.1 A overall, 0.14 A for main-chain atoms of internal segments, and 0.05 A for the iron atoms. The effects of intermolecular contacts on the structure were investigated; such contacts cause only highly localized distortions, as judged from the degree of molecular asymmetry that they induce. The geometry of the iron-nitrogen complex closely resembles that of the deoxymyoglobin structure of Takano (1977) and of the 5-co-ordinated model compounds of Hoard (1975) and Jameson et al. (1980). The distance of the iron from the mean plane of N(porphyrin) is 0.40(5) A and 0.36(5) A, respectively, at the alpha and beta haems, in contrast to the corresponding distance of +0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A in oxyhaemoglobin ( Shaanan , 1983); the Fe-N epsilon (F8) bond length is 2.12(4) A and the Fe-N(porphyrin) bond length is 2.06(2) A; the last is also in good agreement with extended X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurements on deoxyhaemoglobin ( Eisenberger et al., 1978; Perutz et al., 1982). The haems are domed toward the proximal side; the separation between the mean planes of N(porphyrin) and C(porphyrin) being 0.16(6) A and 0.10(6) A, respectively at the alpha and beta haems. At the alpha haems, the normals to the mean pyrrole planes are tilted uniformly toward the haem centre, by about three degrees relative to the haem normal, and there is a folding of about four degrees of the haem about an axis running between the methene carbons that are between the pyrrole rings bearing like-type side-chains. At the beta haems, there is no such folding, and only pyrroles II and IV (those eclipsed by His F8) are appreciably tilted, by about eight degrees. The independence of these parameters from restraints imposed on the model was verified by unrestrained refinement of the entire molecule starting from a structure with modified haem geometry.", "Probing the alpha 1 beta 2 interface of human hemoglobin by mutagenesis. Role of the FG-C contact regions. The allosteric transition of hemoglobin involves an extensive reorganization of the alpha 1 beta 2 interface, in which two contact regions have been identified. This paper concerns at the effect of two mutations located in the \"switch\" (alpha C3 Thr --> Trp) and the \"flexible joint\" (beta C3 Trp --> Thr). We have expressed and characterized one double and two single mutants: Hb alpha T38W/beta W37T, Hb beta W37T, and Hb alpha T38W, whose structure has been determined by crystallography. We present data on: (i) the interface structure in the contact regions, (ii) oxygen and CO binding kinetics and cooperativity, (iii) dissociation rates of deoxy tetramers and association rates of deoxy dimers, and (iv) the effect of NaI on deoxy tetramer dissociation rate constant. All the mutants are tetrameric and T-state in the deoxygenated derivative. Reassociation of deoxygenated dimers is not modified by interface mutations. DeoxyHb alpha T38W/beta W37T dissociate much faster. We propose a binding site for I- at the switch region. The single mutants binds O2 cooperatively; the double one is almost non-cooperative, a feature confirmed by CO binding. The functional data, analyzed with the two-state model, indicate that these mutations reduce the value of the allosteric constant LO.", "Crystallographic evidence for a new ensemble of ligand-induced allosteric transitions in hemoglobin: the T-to-T(high) quaternary transitions. A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface.", "Chloride ion independence of the Bohr effect in a mutant human hemoglobin beta (V1M+H2deleted). A mutant human hemoglobin, beta (V1M+H2 delta), has been constructed. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule.", "Crystallographic evidence for a new ensemble of ligand-induced allosteric transitions in hemoglobin: the T-to-T(high) quaternary transitions.

Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) is very well obeyed in the native protein, but not around the site of the changed residue in the mutant. NCS is also not obeyed by the water molecule invariably found in the alpha-chain haem pocket in room-temperature crystal structures of haemoglobin.

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin.

An alpha-chain variant with a substitution of a glutamate for valine at NA-1 and having an acetylated methionine NH2 terminus. In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."], ["Structural insights into the role of iron-histidine bond cleavage in nitric oxide-induced activation of H-NOX gas sensor proteins. Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein.

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family.", "Ligand Migration and Binding in the Dimeric Hemoglobin of Scapharca inaequivalvis Using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with temperature derivative spectroscopy (TDS) at cryogenic temperatures, we have studied CO binding to the heme and CO migration among cavities in the interior of the dimeric hemoglobin of Scapharca inaequivalvis (HbI) after photodissociation. By combining these studies with X-ray crystallography, three transient ligand docking sites were identified: a primary docking site B in close vicinity to the heme iron, and two secondary docking sites C and D corresponding to the Xe4 and Xe2 cavities of myoglobin. To assess the relevance of these findings for physiological binding, we also performed flash photolysis experiments on HbICO at room temperature and equilibrium binding studies with dioxygen. Our results show that the Xe4 and Xe2 cavities serve as transient docking sites for unbound ligands in the protein, but not as way stations on the entry/exit pathway. For HbI, the so-called histidine gate mechanism proposed for other globins appears as a plausible entry/exit route as well.", "Structural basis of drug binding to CYP46A1, an enzyme that controls cholesterol turnover in the brain.

Structures of the co-complexes demonstrate that each drug binds in a single orientation to the active site with tranylcypromine, thioperamide, and voriconazole coordinating the heme iron via their nitrogen atoms and clotrimazole being at a 4 \u00c5 distance from the heme iron. We show here that clotrimazole is also a substrate for CYP46A1. High affinity for CYP46A1 is determined by a set of specific interactions, some of which were further investigated by solution studies using structural analogs of the drugs and the T306A CYP46A1 mutant. Collectively, our results reveal how diverse inhibitors can be accommodated in the CYP46A1 active site and provide an explanation for the observed differences in the drug-induced spectral response. Co-complexes with tranylcypromine, thioperamide, and voriconazole represent the first structural characterization of the drug binding to a P450 enzyme."]]
