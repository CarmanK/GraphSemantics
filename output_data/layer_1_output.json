[{"phrase": "Sr sulfite", "id": "6", "article": "The octahaem MccA is a haem c-copper sulfite reductase The six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide is the pivot point of the biogeochemical cycle of the element sulfur. The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO.

The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII.

Heme(ii) is the active center of outer-membrane proteins and delivers electrons to acceptors or mediators such as riboflavin, a redox active chromophore present in organisms. However, the EET mechanism via mediators, especially the electron transfer process from outer-membrane proteins to mediators, has not been well documented yet. In this work, the mechanism behind the electron transfer from heme(ii) to riboflavin is investigated by using in situ ultraviolet visible and fluorescence spectroelectrochemical analysis, which provides the information regarding the structural change and electrochemical characteristics of species in the electron transfer process. It is found that hemin(iii), the oxidized form of heme(ii), is electrolyzed to an intermediate \"hemx(ii)\" without structural changes, and is then transformed to heme(ii) by conjugating with riboflavin and its radicals. Heme(ii) is able to activate riboflavin reduction via a two-electron two-proton pathway in aqueous solution. The mechanisms proposed on the basis of experimental results are further confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The results about the electron transfer from hemx(ii) (or heme(ii)) to riboflavin are useful not only for understanding the EET mechanisms, but also for maximizing the role of riboflavin in biogeochemical cycling and environmental bioremediation"}, {"phrase": "redox photosystem II", "id": "15873", "article": "Of the many thousands of new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that are now discovered each year, many possess potential redox activity arising from the constituent metal ions and/or organic ligands, or the guest molecules located within their porous structures.

In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure"}, {"phrase": "W3 photosystem II", "id": "8315", "article": "The study included 1851 patients.
