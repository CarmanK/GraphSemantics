A method and system for high-speed, high-resolution, 3-D imaging of an object including an anamorphic magnification and field lens system to deliver the light reflected from the object to a small area position detector having a position-sensing direction. Preferably, an acousto-optic deflector together with associated lens elements scans a beam of modulated laser light across the object to produce a telecentric, flat field scan. The deflector has a feedback loop to enable uniform illumination of the object. The light scattered from the object is collected by a telecentric receiver lens. A combined spatial and polarization filtering plane preferably in the form of a programmable mask is provided to control the polarization and acceptance angles of the collected light. A reduction or focusing lens is positioned immediately behind the filtering plane and is utilized as a telescope objective. The lens system includes a negative cylinder lens having a relatively large focal length and a field lens having a relatively small focal length. The cylinder lens and the reduction lens magnify the image in the position sensing direction of the detector and the field lens delivers the magnified light to the detector. The detector is a photodetector such as a lateral effect photodiode or a rectangular lateral effect detector. A pre-amplifier provides a pair of electrical signals which are utilized by signal processing circuitry to compute the centroid of the light spot.
