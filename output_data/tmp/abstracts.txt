An acoustic positioning system locates a marine cable at an exploration site, such cable employing a plurality of hydrophones at spaced-apart positions along the cable. A marine vessel measures water depth to the cable as the vessel passes over the cable and interrogates the hydrophones with sonar pulses along a slant range as the vessel travels in a parallel and horizontally offset path to the cable. The location of the hydrophones is determined from the recordings of water depth and slant range.
A method for locating an ocean bottom seismic cable is disclosed wherein a series of shots from a seismic pulse generator are fired. The distance to one seismic pulse detector is determined for each shot defining a spherical surface upon which the detector may be located. The intersection of the spherical surfaces determine the exact location of the detector. Depth detectors may be used to eliminate one half of the possible locations for each shot.
A method is disclosed for determining the separation between a seismic energy source and a seismic sensor, the location of which is known imperfectly. After the source emits a wavefield, the first-arriving impulse at the sensor is statistically processed to form a range statistic that is related to the true travel time between the source and the sensor. A set of range statistics from a plurality of source positions are filtered and converted to range loci, the intersection of which marks the location of the sensor.
One or more slave acoustic transponders are secured to selected parts of a seismic bottom cable whose location is imperfectly known. A master transponder broadcasts an interrogation pulse from each of a number of different, known locations distributed along a line of survey. In response to an interrogation pulse, a slave transponder emits an encoded signal that is received by the master transponder. The acoustic flight time between each pulse broadcast and encoded-signal reception constitutes a range measurement to the participating slave transponder. Resolving a gather of several range measurement from different known broadcast locations, focussed on an identifiable transponder, defines the transponder location.
A high-order polynomial regression curve is fitted to a global set of first arrival times as a function of the nominal ranges between a plurality of acoustic sources having known geodetic coordinates and a plurality of acoustic detectors whose coordinates are imperfectly known. The order of the polynomial is chosen to be that order that minimizes the variance of the parameters about the regression curve. The polynomial is used as a quasi-velocity function for iteratively optimizing the best estimate of the ranges between each detector and every source station. The best estimate of the detector position is derived by multi-lateration using the computed ranges.
