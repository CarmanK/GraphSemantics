A diving head gear includes a form fit mask assembly, a hood assembly, and a breathing block assembly. Custom fitting a mask assembly to a diver''s facial contours as defined by the forehead, temples, and lower jawbone, seals its interior from the surrounding water and allows the comfortable wearing of the mask for prolonged periods of time. Securing the mask assembly onto a wearer''s head by an elastic, custom fitted hood assembly firmly seats the mask assembly in a sealed relationship as well as providing an armor-like protective covering. Mounting a breathing block assembly on an oral compartment of the mask assembly ensures an effortless inhalation and exhalation of gas and, by its unique configuration, the breathing block assembly blocks and purges any leaked water from the breathing system. Thusly provided, the head gear is ideally adaptable to semiclosed and closed underwater breathing systems to prevent the introduction and transfer of leaked water which would eventually reach the CO2 absorption unit and inhibit its functioning. Because each head gear is individually tailored to seat on the nonfleshy, bony portions of the head and face, and only a slight force is required to seal the mask assembly''s interior and no facial pain is suffered. Thus the head gear is ideally suitable for use during saturation diving or military undersea operations where it must be worn for long periods of time. Most of the inherent advantages of the head gear are attributed to the fitting of the mask assembly and its method of construction. Molding a ductile transparent sheet over a negative mold shaped to represent a diver''s head having a builtup template conforming to the internal dimensions of the form fit mask assembly and along a surface representing the bony facial contours of the diver, as defined by his forehead, his temples, and his jawbone, ensures comfortable seating of the mask and prolonged sealing of the interior from the surrounding water.
