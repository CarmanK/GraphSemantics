A safety lock mechanism for a dockboard to prevent lowering of the ramp and eliminating the possibility of gaining access to a building through the space between the lowered ramp and a closed overhead door. The dockboard includes a ramp hinged at its rear edge to the loading dock and a lip is hinged to the front edge of the ramp and is movable between a downwardly hanging, pendant position and an extended position. Cross traffic legs are pivoted to the under surface of the front edge of the ramp and engage fixed legs on the supporting structure of the dockboard to support the ramp in either a dock level position or in a series of below dock level positions. The cross traffic legs are coupled to the lip so that on movement of the lip from the pendant to the extended position, the cross traffic legs will be retracted. The safety lock mechanism includes a flange or stop which is pivotally connected to each fixed leg, and when the cross traffic leg is supported on the fixed leg the flange extends vertically to the rear of the cross traffic leg, to thereby prevent the cross traffic leg from being retracted when the ramp is at a dock level position. In the event that the ramp is just slightly above dock level when a truck pulls away from a dock, the lip will fall to its pendant position and the cross traffic legs will pivot forwardly into engagement with the stop, thereby pivoting the stop forwardly and enabling the cross traffic legs to engage the fixed legs.
