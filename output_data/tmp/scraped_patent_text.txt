A mechanism serving each stack employs a vacuum manifold, having a series of vacuum cups, located on a frame pivotally mounted to move between a sleeve pick-up position over the vertical stack of pre-cut sleeves to a deposit position over the moving web of garment material. As the frame swings, a drive mechanism causes the vacuum head to rotate, flipping the loose end of the sleeve across the web. The frame stops short of contact with the web holding the shoulder portion of the sleeve slightly off of the web until it registers with a line of adhesive carried by the web. The vacuum is then released and air pressure is introduced to blow the sleeve off the vacuum cups and onto the adhesive area on the moving web.
