A university-based inventor may find that there is a \"technology transfer office\" at his or her institution, but that it is poorly equipped to patent and license inventions. In such a case, the inventor may have to play a particularly active role in the patenting process and, especially, the marketing process. Furthermore, university-based inventors may find themselves caught up in issues of academic freedom and potential conflicts of interests. There are often no role models for entrepreneurial activity at a university, and as a result many inventors have had to leave their university positions to pursue financial gain from their inventions. When licensing inventions to companies, the \"NIH syndrome\" can be extremely frustrating. It is often difficult for the inventor to communicate his or her certain knowledge that the invention solves a specific problem perfectly. Also, an inventor may find that even if a company is interested and wishes to license the invention it may ultimately have little or no competence in the subject area and, as a result, the invention never finds its way to commercial production. Nonetheless, the rewards can be well worth the effort. If a successful license is reached and the device goes into production, there may be substantial personal financial reward for the inventor. If the university's patent policy is enlightened, a portion of the royalty income may support ongoing and future activities in the inventor's research laboratory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "article": "IUPAC defines chemoselectivity as \"the preferential reaction of a chemical reagent with one of two or more different functional groups\", a definition that describes in rather understated terms the single greatest obstacle to complex molecule synthesis. Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success."

Cells grown on a plastic substrate consisted of a heterogeneous, largely anaplastic population with a putative enterocytic morphology but with no evidence of junctional complexes or cell polarity typical of an epithelial phenotype. MAC 15j cells from cultures grown on a plastic substrate reestablished a moderate to well-defined degree of differentiation when transplanted back into NMRI mice. When MAC 15j cells were seeded from plastic onto type-I collagen, either attached to plastic or free-floating, tight junctional complexes were formed and the cells began to attain a more recognizable, columnar and polarised epithelial morphology. Cells grown on a type-I collagen gel which was free-floating showed a selective expression of alkaline phosphatase at the apical surfaces of approximately 10% of the cells. This expression was detectable by electron microscope histochemistry but could not be detected biochemically. Treatment of MAC 15j cells grown on a released collagen matrix with tetramethyl-urea (20mM) accelerated the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity at the apical surface as detected by microscopy."

Functional and practical tests were performed in a representative group of patients. Respirators support following the principles of an iron lung may be provided as a supplement or an alternative to existing artificial respirator therapy. The modern artificial respirators are superior to the plastic lung, which however, has advantages for particular indications: Respiratory therapy performed in a plastic lung is well tolerated by the patients. It requires specific skills which can easily be learned by the medical staff. Routine use certainly cannot be instituted before further technical improvement has been achieved; in particular the noise level should be reduced. The plastic lung is suitable for short-term ventilation (2-10 h); in view of the restricted nursing procedures possible, prolonged artificial respiration cannot be recommended. In conclusion, immediate postoperative ventilation is the area of application for the plastic lung. Several advantages are known: the endotracheal tube can be removed, there is no indication for sedative drugs, cardiac function and organ blood flow are positively influenced, mucolysis and lung expansion are adequate. A patient whose spontaneous respiratory activity is borderline benefits from short-term therapy, which can be repeated as necessary. Protracted artificial ventilation can be avoided. The gradual process of weaning from the ventilator following prolonged artificial respiration is facilitated by the use of a plastic lung. Plastic lung therapy is superior to other common methods of treating persistent atelectasis, because its mucolytic effects lead to expansion of the atelectatic lobe or segment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Immunohistochemical studies with an antiserum directed against the CART peptide fragment 55-102 revealed CART-like immunoreactive (CART-LI) nerve fibers in the rat epididymis. The number was highest in the cauda epididymis and became progressively fewer toward the caput epididymis; the vas deferens exhibited an abundance of CART-LI fibers. Injection of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (Fluorochrome, Inc., Englewood, CO) to the junction between the vas deferens and cauda epididymis labeled a large number of neurons in the major pelvic ganglion, some of which were CART-positive. Double-labeling the ganglion sections with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and CART antisera revealed that CART-LI and TH-LI were expressed in two distinct populations of ganglion cells. Some of the TH-LI cells in the ganglia, however, were covered with web-like CART-LI endings. The effects of CART peptide 55-102, referred to herein as CART, on anion secretion in the form of short circuit currents (Isc) were assessed in cultured epithelia. The CART (1 to 5 microM) applied to the basolateral or apical side of the cultured epithelia caused no significant responses on Isc, whereas lys-bradykinin (1 microM) produced a large Isc response in the same preparations. Our results show that CART-LI is present in a population of rat pelvic ganglion cells, which may give rise to CART-LI nerve fibers as observed in the vas deferens and the epididymis. The biological function of CART in the rat epididymis is not known, but it apparently is not involved in ion secretion across the epithelium."

Because these symptoms are not specific, we have proposed that a diagnosis of upper GI GVHD requires histologic confirmation. However, the utility of upper endoscopy in the diagnosis of upper GI GVHD has not been examined. We report a retrospective analysis of 77 allogeneic bone marrow transplantation recipients who received simultaneous upper and lower GI tract biopsies. Upper GI GVHD was found in 44% of patients, of whom 59% also had a positive lower GI tract biopsy (P less than 0.001). Thirty-five percent of the patients with no clinical evidence of lower GI tract GVHD had symptomatic upper GI GVHD confirmed histologically. Patients with and without upper GI GVHD had no significant difference in their clinical symptoms or in their endoscopic findings. We found an association between upper GI and skin GVHD greater than stage I (P = 0.05), a trend to concordance between upper GI GVHD and clinical GVHD in the lower GI tract (P = 0.08), and with the overall clinical GVHD grade (P = 0.08) but no association with clinical liver involvement. Of these 77 patients, 16% had their treatment for acute GVHD changed to include systemic immunosuppression as a result of the upper GI endoscopic biopsy. In addition, 71% had other enteric pathology identified that required specific therapy. These data suggest that upper GI GVHD cannot be diagnosed accurately from its clinical presentation nor inferred from lower GI symptoms or from extraintestinal GVHD. Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy is an important tool in the diagnosis of intestinal GVHD."

Here, we quantitated HMG CoA reductase activity after acute and chronic barrier disruption in the upper and lower layers of murine epidermis. In unperturbed epidermis, 13 and 87% of enzyme activity localized to the upper and lower epidermis, respectively, with the majority of activity in the stratum basale. Acute barrier disruption with either acetone or sodium dodecylsulfate provoked an increase in HMG CoA reductase activity (54% and 30%) in the lower layers, but only a small change in the upper layers. However, the activation state of the enzyme was increased 50% in the upper epidermis. Correction of barrier function by occlusion with an impermeable Latex wrap prevented the increase both in enzyme activity and activation state. After chronic barrier disruption; i.e., essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD) diet, HMG CoA reductase activity was increased in the upper epidermis (161%); a change prevented by occlusion. These results show: (1) that HMG CoA reductase activity is present in both the upper and lower cell layers; (2) that acute insults to barrier integrity stimulate enzyme activity in both the upper and lower epidermis; and (3) that chronic insults provoke an increase in enzyme activity in the upper layers. These studies provide further insights into the linkage of the permeability barrier with epidermal cholesterol metabolism."

The initial population resulted from a balanced intercrossing of 8 inbred strains of mice. The tumors, induced by a single application of DMBA (initiation) and twice weekly applications of TPA (promotion), were benign papillomas; their number at the end of the promotion period was the phenotype chosen for assortative mating. Afterward, the majority of them regressed while others progressed to malignant carcinomas. The Car-R line was selected through a strong challenge, while the Car-S line selection was based on responses to decreasing concentrations of DMBA and TPA. The selection limit was reached after 14 or 15 generations showing progressive interline divergence, which strongly suggests the interaction of several quantitative trait loci (QTL). The phenotypic difference was extremely large: the tumor response was 73 times higher in Car-S than in Car-R mice, though the applied concentrations of DMBA and TPA were 100 and 40 times lower, respectively. The mean heritability realized during the selective breeding was 0.20 in Car-R and 0.49 in Car-S. Our results are compatible with a minimal QTL estimate of 8 in the Car-R line and of 9 or 10 in the Car-S line. The Car-S line is also much more susceptible to carcinoma induction. An association of coat color with tumorigenesis was observed in interline F2 segregants. The Car-R and Car-S lines, obtained through a long-lasting breeding program, are a unique model for identifying the QTL involved in chemical tumorigenesis and will be provided to interested investigators."

It is essentially expressed in the parathyroid glands and along the kidney nephron. The distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and connecting tubules (CNT) in the kidney are involved in active Ca(2+) reabsorption, but the function of the CaR has remained unclear in these segments. Here, the Ca(2+)-selective Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-subtype 5 channel (TRPV5) determines active Ca(2+) reabsorption by forming the apical entry gate. In this study we show that the CaR and TRPV5 co-localize at the luminal membrane of DCT/CNT. Furthermore, by patch-clamp and Fura-2-ratiometric measurements we demonstrate that activation of the CaR leads to elevated TRPV5-mediated currents and increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in cells co-expressing TRPV5 and CaR. Activation of CaR initiated a signaling cascade that activated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-insensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Importantly, mutation of two putative PKC phosphorylation sites, S299 and S654, in TRPV5 prevented the stimulatory effect of CaR activation on channel activity, as did a dominant negative CaR construct, CaR(R185Q). Interestingly, the activity of TRPV6, TRPV5' closest homologue, was not affected by the activated CaR. We conclude that activation of the CaR stimulates TRPV5-mediated Ca(2+) influx via a PMA-insensitive PKC isoform pathway."

This receptor is expressed in human glioblastoma cell line, U87, and here we show that CaR activators stimulate a Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K(+)) channel (CAKC) with a conductance of 140 pS. The responses to CaR activators, however, were blunted in U87 cells transfected with a CaR bearing an inactivating mutation (R185Q) that has previously been shown to exert a dominant negative (DN) action on the wild type receptor. Raising Ca(o) from 0.75 to 2.0 mM or addition of a polycationic CaR agonist, each activated CAKC in nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected U87 cells, while they had little or no effect on channel activity in cells expressing the DN CaR (DN-CaR cells). In nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected cells, the specific 'calcimimetic' CaR activator, NPS R-467, stimulated the channel, while its less active stereoisomer, NPS S-467, did not. In DN-CaR cells, in contrast, NPS R-467, had no effect on channel activity, suggesting defective coupling of the CaR to this ion channel. CaR-mediated stimulation of these K(+) channels could lead to membrane repolarization and related changes in cellular function under normal conditions. Since the R185Q mutation in the CaR produces a more severe phenotype in humans than most inactivating mutations of this receptor, some of its clinical consequences could potentially result from abnormal CaR-dependent channel functioning."

In mouse and rat liver these compounds elicit transcriptional and phenotypic effects similar to peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) that work through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). Recent studies indicate that along with PPAR alpha other nuclear receptors are required for transcriptional changes in the mouse liver after PFOA exposure including the constitutive activated receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) that regulate xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME). To determine the potential role of CAR/PXR in mediating effects of PFAAs in rat liver, we performed a meta-analysis of transcript profiles from published studies in which rats were exposed to PFOA or PFOS. We compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to prototypical activators of CAR, (phenobarbital (PB)), PXR (pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)), or PPAR alpha (WY-14,643 (WY)). As expected, PFOA and PFOS elicited transcript profile signatures that included many known PPAR alpha target genes. Numerous XME genes were also altered by PFOA and PFOS but not WY. These genes exhibited expression changes shared with PB or PCN. Reexamination of the transcript profiles from the livers of chicken or fish exposed to PFAAs indicated that PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR orthologs were not activated. Our results indicate that PFAAs under these experimental conditions activate PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR in rats but not chicken and fish. Lastly, we discuss evidence that human populations with greater CAR expression have lower body burdens of PFAAs."

In Drosophila, Vps33A is the product of the carnation (car) gene. We generated a null allele of car to test its requirement for trafficking to different organelles. Complete loss of car function is lethal during larval development. Eye-specific loss of Car causes late, light-independent degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Earlier in these cells, two distinct phenotypes were detected. In young adults, autophagosomes amassed indicating that their fusion with lysosomes requires Car. In eye discs, endocytosed receptors and ligands accumulate in Rab7-positive prelysosomal compartments. The requirement of Car for late endosome-to-lysosome fusion in imaginal discs is specific as early endosomes are unaffected. Furthermore, lysosomal delivery is not restored by expression of dVps33B. This specificity reflects the distinct pattern of binding to different Syntaxins in vitro: dVps33B predominantly binds the early endosomal Avl and Car to dSyntaxin16. Consistent with a role in Car-mediated fusion, dSyntaxin16 is not restricted to Golgi membranes but also present on lysosomes."

Individuals with T2DM had smaller hippocampal volumes and exhibited a blunting of the CAR relative to controls, while diurnal cortisol was not affected.

The authors compared VSTM for cars among car experts and car novices. Car experts, but not car novices, demonstrated a VSTM advantage similar to that for faces; this advantage was orientation specific and was correlated with an individual's level of car expertise. Control experiments ruled out accounts based solely on verbal- or long-term memory representations.

Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Major attention has been given to modification of the Ad fiber knob, which is thought to determine virus tropism. However, among the human Ad serotypes with different tissue tropisms, not only the knob but also the length of the fiber shaft domain varies significantly. In this study we attempted to delineate the role of fiber length in coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR)- and non-CAR-mediated infection. A series of Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) capsid-based vectors containing long or short fibers with knob domains derived from Ad5, Ad9, or Ad35 was constructed and tested in adsorption, internalization, and transduction studies. For Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors, a long-shafted fiber was critical for efficient adsorption/internalization and transduction of CAR/alphav integrin-expressing cells. Ad5 capids containing short CAR-recognizing fibers were affected in cell adsorption and infection. In contrast, for the chimeric vectors possessing Ad35 knobs, which enter cells by a CAR/alphav integrin-independent pathway, fiber shaft length had no significant influence on binding or infectibility on tested cells. The weak attachment of short-shafted Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors seems to be causally associated with a charge-dependent repulsion between Ad5 capsid and acidic cell surface proteins. The differences between short- and long-shafted vectors in attachment or infection were abrogated by preincubation of cells with polycations. This study demonstrates that the fiber-CAR interaction is not the sole determinant for tropism of Ad vectors containing chimeric fibers. CAR- and alphav integrin-mediated infections are influenced by other factors, including the length of the fiber shaft."

The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes metabolize xenobiotics and thus are a primary defence against these compounds. Increased expression of specific CYP genes in response to particular xenobiotics is a central component of this defence, although such induction can also increase production of toxic metabolites. Here we show that the nuclear receptor CAR mediates the response evoked by a class of xenobiotics known as the 'phenobarbital-like inducers'. The strong activation of Cyp2b10 gene expression by phenobarbital, or by the more potent TCPOBOP, is absent in mice lacking the CAR gene. These animals also show decreased metabolism of the classic CYP substrate zoxazolamine and a complete loss of the liver hypertrophic and hyperplastic responses to these inducers. Cocaine causes acute hepatotoxicity in wild-type mice previously exposed to phenobarbital-like inducers and this toxicity is also absent in the CAR-deficient animals. Thus, loss of CAR function alters sensitivity to toxins, increasing or decreasing it depending on the compound. Modulation of CAR activity in humans may significantly affect metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics."

The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease."

The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations. As could be expected, genetic differentiation (FST) was significantly correlated with physical distance, but the westernmost population (Ivory Coast) showed values that were intermediate between the central (Gabon) and Eastern (Tanzania) populations. A migration-drift equilibrium in a stable continuum of populations did not appear adequate to describe the observed distribution. It seems probable that the species has undergone abrupt changes involving isolation, merging and migration of populations, as a consequence of repeated waves of forest fragmentation and coalescence."

As yet, there is no broadly accepted explanation for this difference. Current investigations focus on the ocean's 'biological pump', the sequestration of carbon in the ocean interior by the rain of organic carbon out of the surface ocean, and its effect on the burial of calcium carbonate in marine sediments. Some researchers surmise that the whole-ocean reservoir of algal nutrients was larger during glacial times, strengthening the biological pump at low latitudes, where these nutrients are currently limiting. Others propose that the biological pump was more efficient during glacial times because of more complete utilization of nutrients at high latitudes, where much of the nutrient supply currently goes unused. We present a version of the latter hypothesis that focuses on the open ocean surrounding Antarctica, involving both the biology and physics of that region."

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

Furthermore, university-based inventors may find themselves caught up in issues of academic freedom and potential conflicts of interests. There are often no role models for entrepreneurial activity at a university, and as a result many inventors have had to leave their university positions to pursue financial gain from their inventions. When licensing inventions to companies, the \"NIH syndrome\" can be extremely frustrating. It is often difficult for the inventor to communicate his or her certain knowledge that the invention solves a specific problem perfectly. Also, an inventor may find that even if a company is interested and wishes to license the invention it may ultimately have little or no competence in the subject area and, as a result, the invention never finds its way to commercial production.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success."

Cells grown on a plastic substrate consisted of a heterogeneous, largely anaplastic population with a putative enterocytic morphology but with no evidence of junctional complexes or cell polarity typical of an epithelial phenotype. MAC 15j cells from cultures grown on a plastic substrate reestablished a moderate to well-defined degree of differentiation when transplanted back into NMRI mice. When MAC 15j cells were seeded from plastic onto type-I collagen, either attached to plastic or free-floating, tight junctional complexes were formed and the cells began to attain a more recognizable, columnar and polarised epithelial morphology. Cells grown on a type-I collagen gel which was free-floating showed a selective expression of alkaline phosphatase at the apical surfaces of approximately 10% of the cells. This expression was detectable by electron microscope histochemistry but could not be detected biochemically. Treatment of MAC 15j cells grown on a released collagen matrix with tetramethyl-urea (20mM) accelerated the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity at the apical surface as detected by microscopy."

Functional and practical tests were performed in a representative group of patients. Respirators support following the principles of an iron lung may be provided as a supplement or an alternative to existing artificial respirator therapy. The modern artificial respirators are superior to the plastic lung, which however, has advantages for particular indications: Respiratory therapy performed in a plastic lung is well tolerated by the patients. It requires specific skills which can easily be learned by the medical staff. Routine use certainly cannot be instituted before further technical improvement has been achieved; in particular the noise level should be reduced. The plastic lung is suitable for short-term ventilation (2-10 h); in view of the restricted nursing procedures possible, prolonged artificial respiration cannot be recommended. In conclusion, immediate postoperative ventilation is the area of application for the plastic lung. Several advantages are known: the endotracheal tube can be removed, there is no indication for sedative drugs, cardiac function and organ blood flow are positively influenced, mucolysis and lung expansion are adequate. A patient whose spontaneous respiratory activity is borderline benefits from short-term therapy, which can be repeated as necessary. Protracted artificial ventilation can be avoided. The gradual process of weaning from the ventilator following prolonged artificial respiration is facilitated by the use of a plastic lung. Plastic lung therapy is superior to other common methods of treating persistent atelectasis, because its mucolytic effects lead to expansion of the atelectatic lobe or segment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Immunohistochemical studies with an antiserum directed against the CART peptide fragment 55-102 revealed CART-like immunoreactive (CART-LI) nerve fibers in the rat epididymis. The number was highest in the cauda epididymis and became progressively fewer toward the caput epididymis; the vas deferens exhibited an abundance of CART-LI fibers. Injection of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (Fluorochrome, Inc., Englewood, CO) to the junction between the vas deferens and cauda epididymis labeled a large number of neurons in the major pelvic ganglion, some of which were CART-positive. Double-labeling the ganglion sections with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and CART antisera revealed that CART-LI and TH-LI were expressed in two distinct populations of ganglion cells. Some of the TH-LI cells in the ganglia, however, were covered with web-like CART-LI endings. The effects of CART peptide 55-102, referred to herein as CART, on anion secretion in the form of short circuit currents (Isc) were assessed in cultured epithelia. The CART (1 to 5 microM) applied to the basolateral or apical side of the cultured epithelia caused no significant responses on Isc, whereas lys-bradykinin (1 microM) produced a large Isc response in the same preparations. Our results show that CART-LI is present in a population of rat pelvic ganglion cells, which may give rise to CART-LI nerve fibers as observed in the vas deferens and the epididymis. The biological function of CART in the rat epididymis is not known, but it apparently is not involved in ion secretion across the epithelium."

Because these symptoms are not specific, we have proposed that a diagnosis of upper GI GVHD requires histologic confirmation. However, the utility of upper endoscopy in the diagnosis of upper GI GVHD has not been examined. We report a retrospective analysis of 77 allogeneic bone marrow transplantation recipients who received simultaneous upper and lower GI tract biopsies. Upper GI GVHD was found in 44% of patients, of whom 59% also had a positive lower GI tract biopsy (P less than 0.001). Thirty-five percent of the patients with no clinical evidence of lower GI tract GVHD had symptomatic upper GI GVHD confirmed histologically. Patients with and without upper GI GVHD had no significant difference in their clinical symptoms or in their endoscopic findings. We found an association between upper GI and skin GVHD greater than stage I (P = 0.05), a trend to concordance between upper GI GVHD and clinical GVHD in the lower GI tract (P = 0.08), and with the overall clinical GVHD grade (P = 0.08) but no association with clinical liver involvement. Of these 77 patients, 16% had their treatment for acute GVHD changed to include systemic immunosuppression as a result of the upper GI endoscopic biopsy. In addition, 71% had other enteric pathology identified that required specific therapy. These data suggest that upper GI GVHD cannot be diagnosed accurately from its clinical presentation nor inferred from lower GI symptoms or from extraintestinal GVHD. Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy is an important tool in the diagnosis of intestinal GVHD."

Based on a risk model previously developed for breast cancer and upper body fat localization, a reduction in estimated breast cancer relative risk of 45% was calculated for the entire group of women who lost 4.5 kg or more in weight. Greater weight loss further reduced upper body fat localization and estimated breast cancer risk based on this model."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mRNA was detected in 33 upper aerodigestive tumors including 26 of 29 nasal tumors (90%), and 7 of 10 extranasal tumors (70%). There was no histologic, immunophenotypic, or genotypic differences according to the lineage and EBV association in upper aerodigestive lymphomas. Among the patients with upper aerodigestive tumors, overall 1-year survival rate was 41%, and correlated well with the stage (P < 0.05) but not with the size of tumor cells, EBV status, and lineage (P > 0.05). Median survival rate of lymphomas from other sites excluding upper aerodigestive tract was not significantly different from that of upper aerodigestive lymphomas with same stage (P > 0.05). Unlike nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphomas, NK precursor lymphoma involved the bone marrow and lymph nodes at initial presentation or in the course of disease. Tumor cells were positive for TdT in all and myeloid markers in two. TCR gene rearrangement was germ line."

It is essentially expressed in the parathyroid glands and along the kidney nephron. The distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and connecting tubules (CNT) in the kidney are involved in active Ca(2+) reabsorption, but the function of the CaR has remained unclear in these segments. Here, the Ca(2+)-selective Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-subtype 5 channel (TRPV5) determines active Ca(2+) reabsorption by forming the apical entry gate. In this study we show that the CaR and TRPV5 co-localize at the luminal membrane of DCT/CNT. Furthermore, by patch-clamp and Fura-2-ratiometric measurements we demonstrate that activation of the CaR leads to elevated TRPV5-mediated currents and increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in cells co-expressing TRPV5 and CaR. Activation of CaR initiated a signaling cascade that activated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-insensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Importantly, mutation of two putative PKC phosphorylation sites, S299 and S654, in TRPV5 prevented the stimulatory effect of CaR activation on channel activity, as did a dominant negative CaR construct, CaR(R185Q). Interestingly, the activity of TRPV6, TRPV5' closest homologue, was not affected by the activated CaR. We conclude that activation of the CaR stimulates TRPV5-mediated Ca(2+) influx via a PMA-insensitive PKC isoform pathway."

This receptor is expressed in human glioblastoma cell line, U87, and here we show that CaR activators stimulate a Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K(+)) channel (CAKC) with a conductance of 140 pS. The responses to CaR activators, however, were blunted in U87 cells transfected with a CaR bearing an inactivating mutation (R185Q) that has previously been shown to exert a dominant negative (DN) action on the wild type receptor. Raising Ca(o) from 0.75 to 2.0 mM or addition of a polycationic CaR agonist, each activated CAKC in nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected U87 cells, while they had little or no effect on channel activity in cells expressing the DN CaR (DN-CaR cells). In nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected cells, the specific 'calcimimetic' CaR activator, NPS R-467, stimulated the channel, while its less active stereoisomer, NPS S-467, did not. In DN-CaR cells, in contrast, NPS R-467, had no effect on channel activity, suggesting defective coupling of the CaR to this ion channel. CaR-mediated stimulation of these K(+) channels could lead to membrane repolarization and related changes in cellular function under normal conditions. Since the R185Q mutation in the CaR produces a more severe phenotype in humans than most inactivating mutations of this receptor, some of its clinical consequences could potentially result from abnormal CaR-dependent channel functioning."

The initial population resulted from a balanced intercrossing of 8 inbred strains of mice. The tumors, induced by a single application of DMBA (initiation) and twice weekly applications of TPA (promotion), were benign papillomas; their number at the end of the promotion period was the phenotype chosen for assortative mating. Afterward, the majority of them regressed while others progressed to malignant carcinomas. The Car-R line was selected through a strong challenge, while the Car-S line selection was based on responses to decreasing concentrations of DMBA and TPA. The selection limit was reached after 14 or 15 generations showing progressive interline divergence, which strongly suggests the interaction of several quantitative trait loci (QTL). The phenotypic difference was extremely large: the tumor response was 73 times higher in Car-S than in Car-R mice, though the applied concentrations of DMBA and TPA were 100 and 40 times lower, respectively. The mean heritability realized during the selective breeding was 0.20 in Car-R and 0.49 in Car-S. Our results are compatible with a minimal QTL estimate of 8 in the Car-R line and of 9 or 10 in the Car-S line. The Car-S line is also much more susceptible to carcinoma induction. An association of coat color with tumorigenesis was observed in interline F2 segregants. The Car-R and Car-S lines, obtained through a long-lasting breeding program, are a unique model for identifying the QTL involved in chemical tumorigenesis and will be provided to interested investigators."

In Drosophila, Vps33A is the product of the carnation (car) gene. We generated a null allele of car to test its requirement for trafficking to different organelles. Complete loss of car function is lethal during larval development. Eye-specific loss of Car causes late, light-independent degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Earlier in these cells, two distinct phenotypes were detected. In young adults, autophagosomes amassed indicating that their fusion with lysosomes requires Car. In eye discs, endocytosed receptors and ligands accumulate in Rab7-positive prelysosomal compartments. The requirement of Car for late endosome-to-lysosome fusion in imaginal discs is specific as early endosomes are unaffected. Furthermore, lysosomal delivery is not restored by expression of dVps33B. This specificity reflects the distinct pattern of binding to different Syntaxins in vitro: dVps33B predominantly binds the early endosomal Avl and Car to dSyntaxin16. Consistent with a role in Car-mediated fusion, dSyntaxin16 is not restricted to Golgi membranes but also present on lysosomes."

We contrasted a group of 18 individuals with T2DM with 12 matched controls on MRI-based hippocampal volume and salivary diurnal cortisol profile including CAR. Individuals with T2DM had smaller hippocampal volumes and exhibited a blunting of the CAR relative to controls, while diurnal cortisol was not affected. Across all subjects, fasting insulin and hippocampal volume were associated with the CAR, independent of diagnosis. Our findings support the hypothesis that hippocampal integrity is an important predictor of the CAR."

Its capacity, however, is greater for faces than for other objects; this advantage may stem from the holistic nature of face processing. If the holistic processing explains this advantage, object expertise--which also relies on holistic processing--should endow experts with a VSTM advantage. The authors compared VSTM for cars among car experts and car novices. Car experts, but not car novices, demonstrated a VSTM advantage similar to that for faces; this advantage was orientation specific and was correlated with an individual's level of car expertise. Control experiments ruled out accounts based solely on verbal- or long-term memory representations. These findings suggest that the processing advantages afforded by visual expertise result in domain-specific increases in VSTM capacity, perhaps by allowing experts to maximize the use of an inherently limited VSTM system."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy.

The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations. As could be expected, genetic differentiation (FST) was significantly correlated with physical distance, but the westernmost population (Ivory Coast) showed values that were intermediate between the central (Gabon) and Eastern (Tanzania) populations.

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

            "article": "IUPAC defines chemoselectivity as \"the preferential reaction of a chemical reagent with one of two or more different functional groups\", a definition that describes in rather understated terms the single greatest obstacle to complex molecule synthesis. Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success."

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Immunohistochemical studies with an antiserum directed against the CART peptide fragment 55-102 revealed CART-like immunoreactive (CART-LI) nerve fibers in the rat epididymis. The number was highest in the cauda epididymis and became progressively fewer toward the caput epididymis; the vas deferens exhibited an abundance of CART-LI fibers. Injection of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (Fluorochrome, Inc., Englewood, CO) to the junction between the vas deferens and cauda epididymis labeled a large number of neurons in the major pelvic ganglion, some of which were CART-positive. Double-labeling the ganglion sections with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and CART antisera revealed that CART-LI and TH-LI were expressed in two distinct populations of ganglion cells. Some of the TH-LI cells in the ganglia, however, were covered with web-like CART-LI endings. The effects of CART peptide 55-102, referred to herein as CART, on anion secretion in the form of short circuit currents (Isc) were assessed in cultured epithelia. The CART (1 to 5 microM) applied to the basolateral or apical side of the cultured epithelia caused no significant responses on Isc, whereas lys-bradykinin (1 microM) produced a large Isc response in the same preparations. Our results show that CART-LI is present in a population of rat pelvic ganglion cells, which may give rise to CART-LI nerve fibers as observed in the vas deferens and the epididymis. The biological function of CART in the rat epididymis is not known, but it apparently is not involved in ion secretion across the epithelium."

In 1703, Jean M\u00e9ry reported that the luminosity of the cat's eye could be seen when the animal was held under water, and Mariotte observed that a dog's eye was luminous but erroneously thought this was because its choroid was white. Pr\u00e9vost made a breakthrough when he deduced it was incident light and not light coming out of the eye. Purkinje and von Brucke used lenses to attempt to see the fundus and almost succeeded. However, it was Helmholtz who created the first useable ophthalmoscope, whose development and clinical application are traced in this paper. One of the greatest physical scientists in many spheres of learning, his biography is briefly sketched."

Of 40 cases, 18 (45%) were synchronous, 17 (43%) were metachronous with primary upper urinary tract tumor followed by subsequent bladder tumor 18.5 +/- 14.1 (means +/- SD) months later and 5 (12%) were metachronous with primary bladder tumor followed by subsequent upper urinary tract tumor 40.2 +/- 13.6 months later. The incidence (17/52 = 0.32) of bladder tumor occurrence subsequent to primary upper urinary tract tumor was much higher than that (5/465 = 0.01) of upper urinary tract tumor subsequent to primary bladder tumor. The histologic grades of upper urinary tract tumor and associated bladder tumor were consistent in 73%. Except in 1 case, multiple occurrence of upper urinary tract tumor was always observed unilaterally on the side involved. The current results not only support the theory of multicentricity but raise the possibility that tumor cell implantation may play some role at least in the development of bladder tumor subsequent to upper urinary tract tumor."

It is essentially expressed in the parathyroid glands and along the kidney nephron. The distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and connecting tubules (CNT) in the kidney are involved in active Ca(2+) reabsorption, but the function of the CaR has remained unclear in these segments. Here, the Ca(2+)-selective Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-subtype 5 channel (TRPV5) determines active Ca(2+) reabsorption by forming the apical entry gate. In this study we show that the CaR and TRPV5 co-localize at the luminal membrane of DCT/CNT. Furthermore, by patch-clamp and Fura-2-ratiometric measurements we demonstrate that activation of the CaR leads to elevated TRPV5-mediated currents and increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in cells co-expressing TRPV5 and CaR. Activation of CaR initiated a signaling cascade that activated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-insensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Importantly, mutation of two putative PKC phosphorylation sites, S299 and S654, in TRPV5 prevented the stimulatory effect of CaR activation on channel activity, as did a dominant negative CaR construct, CaR(R185Q). Interestingly, the activity of TRPV6, TRPV5' closest homologue, was not affected by the activated CaR. We conclude that activation of the CaR stimulates TRPV5-mediated Ca(2+) influx via a PMA-insensitive PKC isoform pathway."

This receptor is expressed in human glioblastoma cell line, U87, and here we show that CaR activators stimulate a Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K(+)) channel (CAKC) with a conductance of 140 pS. The responses to CaR activators, however, were blunted in U87 cells transfected with a CaR bearing an inactivating mutation (R185Q) that has previously been shown to exert a dominant negative (DN) action on the wild type receptor. Raising Ca(o) from 0.75 to 2.0 mM or addition of a polycationic CaR agonist, each activated CAKC in nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected U87 cells, while they had little or no effect on channel activity in cells expressing the DN CaR (DN-CaR cells). In nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected cells, the specific 'calcimimetic' CaR activator, NPS R-467, stimulated the channel, while its less active stereoisomer, NPS S-467, did not. In DN-CaR cells, in contrast, NPS R-467, had no effect on channel activity, suggesting defective coupling of the CaR to this ion channel. CaR-mediated stimulation of these K(+) channels could lead to membrane repolarization and related changes in cellular function under normal conditions. Since the R185Q mutation in the CaR produces a more severe phenotype in humans than most inactivating mutations of this receptor, some of its clinical consequences could potentially result from abnormal CaR-dependent channel functioning."

The initial population resulted from a balanced intercrossing of 8 inbred strains of mice. The tumors, induced by a single application of DMBA (initiation) and twice weekly applications of TPA (promotion), were benign papillomas; their number at the end of the promotion period was the phenotype chosen for assortative mating. Afterward, the majority of them regressed while others progressed to malignant carcinomas. The Car-R line was selected through a strong challenge, while the Car-S line selection was based on responses to decreasing concentrations of DMBA and TPA. The selection limit was reached after 14 or 15 generations showing progressive interline divergence, which strongly suggests the interaction of several quantitative trait loci (QTL). The phenotypic difference was extremely large: the tumor response was 73 times higher in Car-S than in Car-R mice, though the applied concentrations of DMBA and TPA were 100 and 40 times lower, respectively. The mean heritability realized during the selective breeding was 0.20 in Car-R and 0.49 in Car-S. Our results are compatible with a minimal QTL estimate of 8 in the Car-R line and of 9 or 10 in the Car-S line. The Car-S line is also much more susceptible to carcinoma induction. An association of coat color with tumorigenesis was observed in interline F2 segregants. The Car-R and Car-S lines, obtained through a long-lasting breeding program, are a unique model for identifying the QTL involved in chemical tumorigenesis and will be provided to interested investigators."

In Drosophila, Vps33A is the product of the carnation (car) gene. We generated a null allele of car to test its requirement for trafficking to different organelles. Complete loss of car function is lethal during larval development. Eye-specific loss of Car causes late, light-independent degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Earlier in these cells, two distinct phenotypes were detected. In young adults, autophagosomes amassed indicating that their fusion with lysosomes requires Car. In eye discs, endocytosed receptors and ligands accumulate in Rab7-positive prelysosomal compartments. The requirement of Car for late endosome-to-lysosome fusion in imaginal discs is specific as early endosomes are unaffected. Furthermore, lysosomal delivery is not restored by expression of dVps33B. This specificity reflects the distinct pattern of binding to different Syntaxins in vitro: dVps33B predominantly binds the early endosomal Avl and Car to dSyntaxin16. Consistent with a role in Car-mediated fusion, dSyntaxin16 is not restricted to Golgi membranes but also present on lysosomes."

We contrasted a group of 18 individuals with T2DM with 12 matched controls on MRI-based hippocampal volume and salivary diurnal cortisol profile including CAR. Individuals with T2DM had smaller hippocampal volumes and exhibited a blunting of the CAR relative to controls, while diurnal cortisol was not affected. Across all subjects, fasting insulin and hippocampal volume were associated with the CAR, independent of diagnosis.

Its capacity, however, is greater for faces than for other objects; this advantage may stem from the holistic nature of face processing. If the holistic processing explains this advantage, object expertise--which also relies on holistic processing--should endow experts with a VSTM advantage. The authors compared VSTM for cars among car experts and car novices. Car experts, but not car novices, demonstrated a VSTM advantage similar to that for faces; this advantage was orientation specific and was correlated with an individual's level of car expertise. Control experiments ruled out accounts based solely on verbal- or long-term memory representations. These findings suggest that the processing advantages afforded by visual expertise result in domain-specific increases in VSTM capacity, perhaps by allowing experts to maximize the use of an inherently limited VSTM system."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Major attention has been given to modification of the Ad fiber knob, which is thought to determine virus tropism. However, among the human Ad serotypes with different tissue tropisms, not only the knob but also the length of the fiber shaft domain varies significantly. In this study we attempted to delineate the role of fiber length in coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR)- and non-CAR-mediated infection. A series of Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) capsid-based vectors containing long or short fibers with knob domains derived from Ad5, Ad9, or Ad35 was constructed and tested in adsorption, internalization, and transduction studies. For Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors, a long-shafted fiber was critical for efficient adsorption/internalization and transduction of CAR/alphav integrin-expressing cells. Ad5 capids containing short CAR-recognizing fibers were affected in cell adsorption and infection. In contrast, for the chimeric vectors possessing Ad35 knobs, which enter cells by a CAR/alphav integrin-independent pathway, fiber shaft length had no significant influence on binding or infectibility on tested cells. The weak attachment of short-shafted Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors seems to be causally associated with a charge-dependent repulsion between Ad5 capsid and acidic cell surface proteins. The differences between short- and long-shafted vectors in attachment or infection were abrogated by preincubation of cells with polycations. This study demonstrates that the fiber-CAR interaction is not the sole determinant for tropism of Ad vectors containing chimeric fibers. CAR- and alphav integrin-mediated infections are influenced by other factors, including the length of the fiber shaft."

Furthermore, university-based inventors may find themselves caught up in issues of academic freedom and potential conflicts of interests. There are often no role models for entrepreneurial activity at a university, and as a result many inventors have had to leave their university positions to pursue financial gain from their inventions. When licensing inventions to companies, the \"NIH syndrome\" can be extremely frustrating. It is often difficult for the inventor to communicate his or her certain knowledge that the invention solves a specific problem perfectly. Also, an inventor may find that even if a company is interested and wishes to license the invention it may ultimately have little or no competence in the subject area and, as a result, the invention never finds its way to commercial production. Nonetheless, the rewards can be well worth the effort. If a successful license is reached and the device goes into production, there may be substantial personal financial reward for the inventor.

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

As for the relationship between energy and sleep, a loss of energy appeared to predict longer sleep on that night and the next night (7 of 10 patients), whereas there was no evidence that prolonged sleep influenced energy on the following and subsequent days."

A university-based inventor may find that there is a \"technology transfer office\" at his or her institution, but that it is poorly equipped to patent and license inventions. In such a case, the inventor may have to play a particularly active role in the patenting process and, especially, the marketing process. Furthermore, university-based inventors may find themselves caught up in issues of academic freedom and potential conflicts of interests. There are often no role models for entrepreneurial activity at a university, and as a result many inventors have had to leave their university positions to pursue financial gain from their inventions. When licensing inventions to companies, the \"NIH syndrome\" can be extremely frustrating. It is often difficult for the inventor to communicate his or her certain knowledge that the invention solves a specific problem perfectly. Also, an inventor may find that even if a company is interested and wishes to license the invention it may ultimately have little or no competence in the subject area and, as a result, the invention never finds its way to commercial production. Nonetheless, the rewards can be well worth the effort. If a successful license is reached and the device goes into production, there may be substantial personal financial reward for the inventor. If the university's patent policy is enlightened, a portion of the royalty income may support ongoing and future activities in the inventor's research laboratory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

All had been treated by a radical protocol which included early soft-tissue cover with a muscle flap by a combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery service. Our ideal management is a radical debridement of the wound outside the zone of injury, skeletal stabilisation and early soft-tissue cover with a vascularised muscle flap. All patients were followed clinically and radiologically to union or for one year. After exclusion of four patients (one unrelated death and three patients lost to follow-up), we reviewed 80 patients with 84 fractures. There were 67 men and 13 women with a mean age of 37 years (3 to 89). Five injuries were grade IIIc and 79 grade IIIb; 12 were site 41, 43 were site 42 and 29 were site 43. Debridement and stabilisation of the fracture were invariably performed immediately. In 33 cases the soft-tissue reconstruction was also completed in a single stage, while in a further 30 it was achieved within 72 hours. In the remaining 21 there was a delay beyond 72 hours, often for critical reasons unrelated to the limb injury. All grade-IIIc injuries underwent immediate vascular reconstruction, with an immediate cover by a flap in two. All were salvaged. There were four amputations, one early, one mid-term and two late, giving a final rate of limb salvage of 95%. Overall, nine pedicled and 75 free muscle flaps were used; the rate of flap failure was 3.5%. Stabilisation of the fracture was achieved with 19 external and 65 internal fixation devices (nails or plates). Three patients had significant segmental defects and required bone-transport procedures to achieve bony union. Of the rest, 51 fractures (66%) progressed to primary bony union while 26 (34%) required a bone-stimulating procedure to achieve this outcome. Overall, there was a rate of superficial infection of the skin graft of 6%, of deep infection at the site of the fracture of 9.5%, and of serious pin-track infection of 37% in the external fixator group. At final review all patients were walking freely on united fractures with no evidence of infection. The treatment of these very severe injuries by an aggressive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical approach provides good results; immediate internal fixation and healthy soft-tissue cover with a muscle flap is safe. Indeed, delay in cover (>72 hours) was associated with most of the problems. External fixation was associated with practical difficulties for the plastic surgeons, a number of chronic pin-track infections and our only cases of malunion. We prefer to use internal fixation. We recommend primary referral to a specialist centre whenever possible. If local factors prevent this we suggest that after discussion with the relevant centre, initial debridement and bridging external fixation, followed by transfer, is the safest procedure."

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Immunohistochemical studies with an antiserum directed against the CART peptide fragment 55-102 revealed CART-like immunoreactive (CART-LI) nerve fibers in the rat epididymis. The number was highest in the cauda epididymis and became progressively fewer toward the caput epididymis; the vas deferens exhibited an abundance of CART-LI fibers. Injection of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (Fluorochrome, Inc., Englewood, CO) to the junction between the vas deferens and cauda epididymis labeled a large number of neurons in the major pelvic ganglion, some of which were CART-positive. Double-labeling the ganglion sections with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and CART antisera revealed that CART-LI and TH-LI were expressed in two distinct populations of ganglion cells. Some of the TH-LI cells in the ganglia, however, were covered with web-like CART-LI endings. The effects of CART peptide 55-102, referred to herein as CART, on anion secretion in the form of short circuit currents (Isc) were assessed in cultured epithelia. The CART (1 to 5 microM) applied to the basolateral or apical side of the cultured epithelia caused no significant responses on Isc, whereas lys-bradykinin (1 microM) produced a large Isc response in the same preparations. Our results show that CART-LI is present in a population of rat pelvic ganglion cells, which may give rise to CART-LI nerve fibers as observed in the vas deferens and the epididymis. The biological function of CART in the rat epididymis is not known, but it apparently is not involved in ion secretion across the epithelium."

In fact, brainstem vagovagal neurocircuits comprise highly plastic neurons and synapses connecting afferent vagal fibres, second order neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and efferent fibres originating in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). Neuronal communication between the NTS and DMV is regulated by the presence of a variety of inputs, both from within the brainstem itself as well as from higher centres, which utilize an array of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Because of the circumventricular nature of these brainstem areas, circulating hormones can also modulate the vagal output to the upper gastrointestinal tract. This Review summarizes the organization and function of vagovagal reflex control of the upper gastrointestinal tract, presents data on the plasticity within these neurocircuits after stress, and discusses the gastrointestinal dysfunctions observed in Parkinson disease as examples of physiological adjustment and maladaptation of these reflexes.

Brow lift, transaxillary breast augmentation, and abdominoplasty are all cosmetic procedures with a high demand on inconspicuous scars; however, many investigators are working on reconstructive endoscopically assisted procedures. The treatment of many facial fractures involving the upper third of the facial skeleton usually requires long bicoronal incisions similar to the incisions used in the traditional brow lift. Attempts are under way to use endoscopically assisted minimal-access techniques to reduce and fixate these fractures. Many flaps used in plastic surgery require long scars for harvest, as in the case of the latissimus dorsi muscle flap. A relatively long incision on the back is needed to gain access to the muscle so that it can be elevated from structures superficial and deep to it. Although it is unpopular, investigators have reported harvesting latissimus dorsi muscle flaps through fairly small incisions with the assistance of balloon dissectors and endoscopes. In the field of hand surgery, carpal tunnel release surgery has had more than one method proposed to transect the carpal ligament using endoscopes and special instrumentation. Although some reported series claim excellent results, many hand surgeons are reluctant to use endoscopes because of associated complications and a high recurrence rate of carpal tunnel syndrome. Plastic surgery has special demands that emphasize aesthetics in cosmetic and reconstructive procedures. Although the lack of natural optical cavities has slowed the incorporation of endoscopic surgery in the specialty, surgically created cavities are used to allow for minimal access incisions. The future of plastic surgery will include an ever-increasing number of endoscopically assisted procedures. Cosmetic and reconstructive procedures will benefit from this new technology."

It is essentially expressed in the parathyroid glands and along the kidney nephron. The distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and connecting tubules (CNT) in the kidney are involved in active Ca(2+) reabsorption, but the function of the CaR has remained unclear in these segments. Here, the Ca(2+)-selective Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-subtype 5 channel (TRPV5) determines active Ca(2+) reabsorption by forming the apical entry gate. In this study we show that the CaR and TRPV5 co-localize at the luminal membrane of DCT/CNT. Furthermore, by patch-clamp and Fura-2-ratiometric measurements we demonstrate that activation of the CaR leads to elevated TRPV5-mediated currents and increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in cells co-expressing TRPV5 and CaR. Activation of CaR initiated a signaling cascade that activated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-insensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Importantly, mutation of two putative PKC phosphorylation sites, S299 and S654, in TRPV5 prevented the stimulatory effect of CaR activation on channel activity, as did a dominant negative CaR construct, CaR(R185Q). Interestingly, the activity of TRPV6, TRPV5' closest homologue, was not affected by the activated CaR.

This receptor is expressed in human glioblastoma cell line, U87, and here we show that CaR activators stimulate a Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K(+)) channel (CAKC) with a conductance of 140 pS. The responses to CaR activators, however, were blunted in U87 cells transfected with a CaR bearing an inactivating mutation (R185Q) that has previously been shown to exert a dominant negative (DN) action on the wild type receptor. Raising Ca(o) from 0.75 to 2.0 mM or addition of a polycationic CaR agonist, each activated CAKC in nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected U87 cells, while they had little or no effect on channel activity in cells expressing the DN CaR (DN-CaR cells). In nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected cells, the specific 'calcimimetic' CaR activator, NPS R-467, stimulated the channel, while its less active stereoisomer, NPS S-467, did not. In DN-CaR cells, in contrast, NPS R-467, had no effect on channel activity, suggesting defective coupling of the CaR to this ion channel. CaR-mediated stimulation of these K(+) channels could lead to membrane repolarization and related changes in cellular function under normal conditions. Since the R185Q mutation in the CaR produces a more severe phenotype in humans than most inactivating mutations of this receptor, some of its clinical consequences could potentially result from abnormal CaR-dependent channel functioning."

The initial population resulted from a balanced intercrossing of 8 inbred strains of mice. The tumors, induced by a single application of DMBA (initiation) and twice weekly applications of TPA (promotion), were benign papillomas; their number at the end of the promotion period was the phenotype chosen for assortative mating. Afterward, the majority of them regressed while others progressed to malignant carcinomas. The Car-R line was selected through a strong challenge, while the Car-S line selection was based on responses to decreasing concentrations of DMBA and TPA. The selection limit was reached after 14 or 15 generations showing progressive interline divergence, which strongly suggests the interaction of several quantitative trait loci (QTL). The phenotypic difference was extremely large: the tumor response was 73 times higher in Car-S than in Car-R mice, though the applied concentrations of DMBA and TPA were 100 and 40 times lower, respectively. The mean heritability realized during the selective breeding was 0.20 in Car-R and 0.49 in Car-S. Our results are compatible with a minimal QTL estimate of 8 in the Car-R line and of 9 or 10 in the Car-S line. The Car-S line is also much more susceptible to carcinoma induction. An association of coat color with tumorigenesis was observed in interline F2 segregants. The Car-R and Car-S lines, obtained through a long-lasting breeding program, are a unique model for identifying the QTL involved in chemical tumorigenesis and will be provided to interested investigators."

In Drosophila, Vps33A is the product of the carnation (car) gene. We generated a null allele of car to test its requirement for trafficking to different organelles. Complete loss of car function is lethal during larval development. Eye-specific loss of Car causes late, light-independent degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Earlier in these cells, two distinct phenotypes were detected. In young adults, autophagosomes amassed indicating that their fusion with lysosomes requires Car. In eye discs, endocytosed receptors and ligands accumulate in Rab7-positive prelysosomal compartments. The requirement of Car for late endosome-to-lysosome fusion in imaginal discs is specific as early endosomes are unaffected. Furthermore, lysosomal delivery is not restored by expression of dVps33B. This specificity reflects the distinct pattern of binding to different Syntaxins in vitro: dVps33B predominantly binds the early endosomal Avl and Car to dSyntaxin16. Consistent with a role in Car-mediated fusion, dSyntaxin16 is not restricted to Golgi membranes but also present on lysosomes."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease that is also accompanied by hippocampal atrophy, and therefore can serve as a model for ascertaining the relationship between CAR and hippocampal volume. We contrasted a group of 18 individuals with T2DM with 12 matched controls on MRI-based hippocampal volume and salivary diurnal cortisol profile including CAR. Individuals with T2DM had smaller hippocampal volumes and exhibited a blunting of the CAR relative to controls, while diurnal cortisol was not affected. Across all subjects, fasting insulin and hippocampal volume were associated with the CAR, independent of diagnosis. Our findings support the hypothesis that hippocampal integrity is an important predictor of the CAR."

Its capacity, however, is greater for faces than for other objects; this advantage may stem from the holistic nature of face processing. If the holistic processing explains this advantage, object expertise--which also relies on holistic processing--should endow experts with a VSTM advantage. The authors compared VSTM for cars among car experts and car novices. Car experts, but not car novices, demonstrated a VSTM advantage similar to that for faces; this advantage was orientation specific and was correlated with an individual's level of car expertise. Control experiments ruled out accounts based solely on verbal- or long-term memory representations. These findings suggest that the processing advantages afforded by visual expertise result in domain-specific increases in VSTM capacity, perhaps by allowing experts to maximize the use of an inherently limited VSTM system."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Major attention has been given to modification of the Ad fiber knob, which is thought to determine virus tropism. However, among the human Ad serotypes with different tissue tropisms, not only the knob but also the length of the fiber shaft domain varies significantly. In this study we attempted to delineate the role of fiber length in coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR)- and non-CAR-mediated infection. A series of Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) capsid-based vectors containing long or short fibers with knob domains derived from Ad5, Ad9, or Ad35 was constructed and tested in adsorption, internalization, and transduction studies. For Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors, a long-shafted fiber was critical for efficient adsorption/internalization and transduction of CAR/alphav integrin-expressing cells. Ad5 capids containing short CAR-recognizing fibers were affected in cell adsorption and infection. In contrast, for the chimeric vectors possessing Ad35 knobs, which enter cells by a CAR/alphav integrin-independent pathway, fiber shaft length had no significant influence on binding or infectibility on tested cells. The weak attachment of short-shafted Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors seems to be causally associated with a charge-dependent repulsion between Ad5 capsid and acidic cell surface proteins. The differences between short- and long-shafted vectors in attachment or infection were abrogated by preincubation of cells with polycations. This study demonstrates that the fiber-CAR interaction is not the sole determinant for tropism of Ad vectors containing chimeric fibers. CAR- and alphav integrin-mediated infections are influenced by other factors, including the length of the fiber shaft."

The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes metabolize xenobiotics and thus are a primary defence against these compounds. Increased expression of specific CYP genes in response to particular xenobiotics is a central component of this defence, although such induction can also increase production of toxic metabolites. Here we show that the nuclear receptor CAR mediates the response evoked by a class of xenobiotics known as the 'phenobarbital-like inducers'. The strong activation of Cyp2b10 gene expression by phenobarbital, or by the more potent TCPOBOP, is absent in mice lacking the CAR gene. These animals also show decreased metabolism of the classic CYP substrate zoxazolamine and a complete loss of the liver hypertrophic and hyperplastic responses to these inducers. Cocaine causes acute hepatotoxicity in wild-type mice previously exposed to phenobarbital-like inducers and this toxicity is also absent in the CAR-deficient animals. Thus, loss of CAR function alters sensitivity to toxins, increasing or decreasing it depending on the compound. Modulation of CAR activity in humans may significantly affect metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics."

In mouse and rat liver these compounds elicit transcriptional and phenotypic effects similar to peroxisome proliferator chemicals (PPC) that work through the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). Recent studies indicate that along with PPAR alpha other nuclear receptors are required for transcriptional changes in the mouse liver after PFOA exposure including the constitutive activated receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) that regulate xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME). To determine the potential role of CAR/PXR in mediating effects of PFAAs in rat liver, we performed a meta-analysis of transcript profiles from published studies in which rats were exposed to PFOA or PFOS. We compared the profiles to those produced by exposure to prototypical activators of CAR, (phenobarbital (PB)), PXR (pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN)), or PPAR alpha (WY-14,643 (WY)). As expected, PFOA and PFOS elicited transcript profile signatures that included many known PPAR alpha target genes. Numerous XME genes were also altered by PFOA and PFOS but not WY. These genes exhibited expression changes shared with PB or PCN. Reexamination of the transcript profiles from the livers of chicken or fish exposed to PFAAs indicated that PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR orthologs were not activated. Our results indicate that PFAAs under these experimental conditions activate PPAR alpha, CAR, and PXR in rats but not chicken and fish. Lastly, we discuss evidence that human populations with greater CAR expression have lower body burdens of PFAAs."

Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy.

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

It is essentially expressed in the parathyroid glands and along the kidney nephron. The distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and connecting tubules (CNT) in the kidney are involved in active Ca(2+) reabsorption, but the function of the CaR has remained unclear in these segments. Here, the Ca(2+)-selective Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-subtype 5 channel (TRPV5) determines active Ca(2+) reabsorption by forming the apical entry gate. In this study we show that the CaR and TRPV5 co-localize at the luminal membrane of DCT/CNT. Furthermore, by patch-clamp and Fura-2-ratiometric measurements we demonstrate that activation of the CaR leads to elevated TRPV5-mediated currents and increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in cells co-expressing TRPV5 and CaR. Activation of CaR initiated a signaling cascade that activated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-insensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Importantly, mutation of two putative PKC phosphorylation sites, S299 and S654, in TRPV5 prevented the stimulatory effect of CaR activation on channel activity, as did a dominant negative CaR construct, CaR(R185Q). Interestingly, the activity of TRPV6, TRPV5' closest homologue, was not affected by the activated CaR. We conclude that activation of the CaR stimulates TRPV5-mediated Ca(2+) influx via a PMA-insensitive PKC isoform pathway."

This receptor is expressed in human glioblastoma cell line, U87, and here we show that CaR activators stimulate a Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K(+)) channel (CAKC) with a conductance of 140 pS. The responses to CaR activators, however, were blunted in U87 cells transfected with a CaR bearing an inactivating mutation (R185Q) that has previously been shown to exert a dominant negative (DN) action on the wild type receptor. Raising Ca(o) from 0.75 to 2.0 mM or addition of a polycationic CaR agonist, each activated CAKC in nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected U87 cells, while they had little or no effect on channel activity in cells expressing the DN CaR (DN-CaR cells). In nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected cells, the specific 'calcimimetic' CaR activator, NPS R-467, stimulated the channel, while its less active stereoisomer, NPS S-467, did not. In DN-CaR cells, in contrast, NPS R-467, had no effect on channel activity, suggesting defective coupling of the CaR to this ion channel. CaR-mediated stimulation of these K(+) channels could lead to membrane repolarization and related changes in cellular function under normal conditions. Since the R185Q mutation in the CaR produces a more severe phenotype in humans than most inactivating mutations of this receptor, some of its clinical consequences could potentially result from abnormal CaR-dependent channel functioning."

The initial population resulted from a balanced intercrossing of 8 inbred strains of mice. The tumors, induced by a single application of DMBA (initiation) and twice weekly applications of TPA (promotion), were benign papillomas; their number at the end of the promotion period was the phenotype chosen for assortative mating. Afterward, the majority of them regressed while others progressed to malignant carcinomas. The Car-R line was selected through a strong challenge, while the Car-S line selection was based on responses to decreasing concentrations of DMBA and TPA. The selection limit was reached after 14 or 15 generations showing progressive interline divergence, which strongly suggests the interaction of several quantitative trait loci (QTL). The phenotypic difference was extremely large: the tumor response was 73 times higher in Car-S than in Car-R mice, though the applied concentrations of DMBA and TPA were 100 and 40 times lower, respectively. The mean heritability realized during the selective breeding was 0.20 in Car-R and 0.49 in Car-S. Our results are compatible with a minimal QTL estimate of 8 in the Car-R line and of 9 or 10 in the Car-S line. The Car-S line is also much more susceptible to carcinoma induction. An association of coat color with tumorigenesis was observed in interline F2 segregants. The Car-R and Car-S lines, obtained through a long-lasting breeding program, are a unique model for identifying the QTL involved in chemical tumorigenesis and will be provided to interested investigators."

In Drosophila, Vps33A is the product of the carnation (car) gene. We generated a null allele of car to test its requirement for trafficking to different organelles. Complete loss of car function is lethal during larval development. Eye-specific loss of Car causes late, light-independent degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Earlier in these cells, two distinct phenotypes were detected. In young adults, autophagosomes amassed indicating that their fusion with lysosomes requires Car. In eye discs, endocytosed receptors and ligands accumulate in Rab7-positive prelysosomal compartments. The requirement of Car for late endosome-to-lysosome fusion in imaginal discs is specific as early endosomes are unaffected. Furthermore, lysosomal delivery is not restored by expression of dVps33B. This specificity reflects the distinct pattern of binding to different Syntaxins in vitro: dVps33B predominantly binds the early endosomal Avl and Car to dSyntaxin16. Consistent with a role in Car-mediated fusion, dSyntaxin16 is not restricted to Golgi membranes but also present on lysosomes."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease that is also accompanied by hippocampal atrophy, and therefore can serve as a model for ascertaining the relationship between CAR and hippocampal volume. We contrasted a group of 18 individuals with T2DM with 12 matched controls on MRI-based hippocampal volume and salivary diurnal cortisol profile including CAR. Individuals with T2DM had smaller hippocampal volumes and exhibited a blunting of the CAR relative to controls, while diurnal cortisol was not affected. Across all subjects, fasting insulin and hippocampal volume were associated with the CAR, independent of diagnosis. Our findings support the hypothesis that hippocampal integrity is an important predictor of the CAR."

Its capacity, however, is greater for faces than for other objects; this advantage may stem from the holistic nature of face processing. If the holistic processing explains this advantage, object expertise--which also relies on holistic processing--should endow experts with a VSTM advantage. The authors compared VSTM for cars among car experts and car novices. Car experts, but not car novices, demonstrated a VSTM advantage similar to that for faces; this advantage was orientation specific and was correlated with an individual's level of car expertise. Control experiments ruled out accounts based solely on verbal- or long-term memory representations. These findings suggest that the processing advantages afforded by visual expertise result in domain-specific increases in VSTM capacity, perhaps by allowing experts to maximize the use of an inherently limited VSTM system."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Major attention has been given to modification of the Ad fiber knob, which is thought to determine virus tropism. However, among the human Ad serotypes with different tissue tropisms, not only the knob but also the length of the fiber shaft domain varies significantly. In this study we attempted to delineate the role of fiber length in coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR)- and non-CAR-mediated infection. A series of Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) capsid-based vectors containing long or short fibers with knob domains derived from Ad5, Ad9, or Ad35 was constructed and tested in adsorption, internalization, and transduction studies. For Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors, a long-shafted fiber was critical for efficient adsorption/internalization and transduction of CAR/alphav integrin-expressing cells. Ad5 capids containing short CAR-recognizing fibers were affected in cell adsorption and infection. In contrast, for the chimeric vectors possessing Ad35 knobs, which enter cells by a CAR/alphav integrin-independent pathway, fiber shaft length had no significant influence on binding or infectibility on tested cells. The weak attachment of short-shafted Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors seems to be causally associated with a charge-dependent repulsion between Ad5 capsid and acidic cell surface proteins. The differences between short- and long-shafted vectors in attachment or infection were abrogated by preincubation of cells with polycations. This study demonstrates that the fiber-CAR interaction is not the sole determinant for tropism of Ad vectors containing chimeric fibers. CAR- and alphav integrin-mediated infections are influenced by other factors, including the length of the fiber shaft."

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

The number was highest in the cauda epididymis and became progressively fewer toward the caput epididymis; the vas deferens exhibited an abundance of CART-LI fibers. Injection of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (Fluorochrome, Inc., Englewood, CO) to the junction between the vas deferens and cauda epididymis labeled a large number of neurons in the major pelvic ganglion, some of which were CART-positive. Double-labeling the ganglion sections with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and CART antisera revealed that CART-LI and TH-LI were expressed in two distinct populations of ganglion cells. Some of the TH-LI cells in the ganglia, however, were covered with web-like CART-LI endings. The effects of CART peptide 55-102, referred to herein as CART, on anion secretion in the form of short circuit currents (Isc) were assessed in cultured epithelia. The CART (1 to 5 microM) applied to the basolateral or apical side of the cultured epithelia caused no significant responses on Isc, whereas lys-bradykinin (1 microM) produced a large Isc response in the same preparations. Our results show that CART-LI is present in a population of rat pelvic ganglion cells, which may give rise to CART-LI nerve fibers as observed in the vas deferens and the epididymis.

Immunohistochemical studies with an antiserum directed against the CART peptide fragment 55-102 revealed CART-like immunoreactive (CART-LI) nerve fibers in the rat epididymis. The number was highest in the cauda epididymis and became progressively fewer toward the caput epididymis; the vas deferens exhibited an abundance of CART-LI fibers. Injection of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (Fluorochrome, Inc., Englewood, CO) to the junction between the vas deferens and cauda epididymis labeled a large number of neurons in the major pelvic ganglion, some of which were CART-positive. Double-labeling the ganglion sections with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and CART antisera revealed that CART-LI and TH-LI were expressed in two distinct populations of ganglion cells. Some of the TH-LI cells in the ganglia, however, were covered with web-like CART-LI endings. The effects of CART peptide 55-102, referred to herein as CART, on anion secretion in the form of short circuit currents (Isc) were assessed in cultured epithelia. The CART (1 to 5 microM) applied to the basolateral or apical side of the cultured epithelia caused no significant responses on Isc, whereas lys-bradykinin (1 microM) produced a large Isc response in the same preparations. Our results show that CART-LI is present in a population of rat pelvic ganglion cells, which may give rise to CART-LI nerve fibers as observed in the vas deferens and the epididymis. The biological function of CART in the rat epididymis is not known, but it apparently is not involved in ion secretion across the epithelium."

It is essentially expressed in the parathyroid glands and along the kidney nephron. The distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and connecting tubules (CNT) in the kidney are involved in active Ca(2+) reabsorption, but the function of the CaR has remained unclear in these segments. Here, the Ca(2+)-selective Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-subtype 5 channel (TRPV5) determines active Ca(2+) reabsorption by forming the apical entry gate. In this study we show that the CaR and TRPV5 co-localize at the luminal membrane of DCT/CNT. Furthermore, by patch-clamp and Fura-2-ratiometric measurements we demonstrate that activation of the CaR leads to elevated TRPV5-mediated currents and increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in cells co-expressing TRPV5 and CaR. Activation of CaR initiated a signaling cascade that activated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-insensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Importantly, mutation of two putative PKC phosphorylation sites, S299 and S654, in TRPV5 prevented the stimulatory effect of CaR activation on channel activity, as did a dominant negative CaR construct, CaR(R185Q). Interestingly, the activity of TRPV6, TRPV5' closest homologue, was not affected by the activated CaR. We conclude that activation of the CaR stimulates TRPV5-mediated Ca(2+) influx via a PMA-insensitive PKC isoform pathway."

This receptor is expressed in human glioblastoma cell line, U87, and here we show that CaR activators stimulate a Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K(+)) channel (CAKC) with a conductance of 140 pS. The responses to CaR activators, however, were blunted in U87 cells transfected with a CaR bearing an inactivating mutation (R185Q) that has previously been shown to exert a dominant negative (DN) action on the wild type receptor. Raising Ca(o) from 0.75 to 2.0 mM or addition of a polycationic CaR agonist, each activated CAKC in nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected U87 cells, while they had little or no effect on channel activity in cells expressing the DN CaR (DN-CaR cells). In nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected cells, the specific 'calcimimetic' CaR activator, NPS R-467, stimulated the channel, while its less active stereoisomer, NPS S-467, did not. In DN-CaR cells, in contrast, NPS R-467, had no effect on channel activity, suggesting defective coupling of the CaR to this ion channel. CaR-mediated stimulation of these K(+) channels could lead to membrane repolarization and related changes in cellular function under normal conditions. Since the R185Q mutation in the CaR produces a more severe phenotype in humans than most inactivating mutations of this receptor, some of its clinical consequences could potentially result from abnormal CaR-dependent channel functioning."

The initial population resulted from a balanced intercrossing of 8 inbred strains of mice. The tumors, induced by a single application of DMBA (initiation) and twice weekly applications of TPA (promotion), were benign papillomas; their number at the end of the promotion period was the phenotype chosen for assortative mating. Afterward, the majority of them regressed while others progressed to malignant carcinomas. The Car-R line was selected through a strong challenge, while the Car-S line selection was based on responses to decreasing concentrations of DMBA and TPA. The selection limit was reached after 14 or 15 generations showing progressive interline divergence, which strongly suggests the interaction of several quantitative trait loci (QTL). The phenotypic difference was extremely large: the tumor response was 73 times higher in Car-S than in Car-R mice, though the applied concentrations of DMBA and TPA were 100 and 40 times lower, respectively. The mean heritability realized during the selective breeding was 0.20 in Car-R and 0.49 in Car-S. Our results are compatible with a minimal QTL estimate of 8 in the Car-R line and of 9 or 10 in the Car-S line. The Car-S line is also much more susceptible to carcinoma induction. An association of coat color with tumorigenesis was observed in interline F2 segregants. The Car-R and Car-S lines, obtained through a long-lasting breeding program, are a unique model for identifying the QTL involved in chemical tumorigenesis and will be provided to interested investigators."

In Drosophila, Vps33A is the product of the carnation (car) gene. We generated a null allele of car to test its requirement for trafficking to different organelles. Complete loss of car function is lethal during larval development. Eye-specific loss of Car causes late, light-independent degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Earlier in these cells, two distinct phenotypes were detected. In young adults, autophagosomes amassed indicating that their fusion with lysosomes requires Car. In eye discs, endocytosed receptors and ligands accumulate in Rab7-positive prelysosomal compartments. The requirement of Car for late endosome-to-lysosome fusion in imaginal discs is specific as early endosomes are unaffected. Furthermore, lysosomal delivery is not restored by expression of dVps33B. This specificity reflects the distinct pattern of binding to different Syntaxins in vitro: dVps33B predominantly binds the early endosomal Avl and Car to dSyntaxin16. Consistent with a role in Car-mediated fusion, dSyntaxin16 is not restricted to Golgi membranes but also present on lysosomes."

We contrasted a group of 18 individuals with T2DM with 12 matched controls on MRI-based hippocampal volume and salivary diurnal cortisol profile including CAR. Individuals with T2DM had smaller hippocampal volumes and exhibited a blunting of the CAR relative to controls, while diurnal cortisol was not affected. Across all subjects, fasting insulin and hippocampal volume were associated with the CAR, independent of diagnosis. Our findings support the hypothesis that hippocampal integrity is an important predictor of the CAR."

Its capacity, however, is greater for faces than for other objects; this advantage may stem from the holistic nature of face processing. If the holistic processing explains this advantage, object expertise--which also relies on holistic processing--should endow experts with a VSTM advantage. The authors compared VSTM for cars among car experts and car novices. Car experts, but not car novices, demonstrated a VSTM advantage similar to that for faces; this advantage was orientation specific and was correlated with an individual's level of car expertise. Control experiments ruled out accounts based solely on verbal- or long-term memory representations. These findings suggest that the processing advantages afforded by visual expertise result in domain-specific increases in VSTM capacity, perhaps by allowing experts to maximize the use of an inherently limited VSTM system."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Major attention has been given to modification of the Ad fiber knob, which is thought to determine virus tropism. However, among the human Ad serotypes with different tissue tropisms, not only the knob but also the length of the fiber shaft domain varies significantly. In this study we attempted to delineate the role of fiber length in coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR)- and non-CAR-mediated infection. A series of Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) capsid-based vectors containing long or short fibers with knob domains derived from Ad5, Ad9, or Ad35 was constructed and tested in adsorption, internalization, and transduction studies. For Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors, a long-shafted fiber was critical for efficient adsorption/internalization and transduction of CAR/alphav integrin-expressing cells. Ad5 capids containing short CAR-recognizing fibers were affected in cell adsorption and infection. In contrast, for the chimeric vectors possessing Ad35 knobs, which enter cells by a CAR/alphav integrin-independent pathway, fiber shaft length had no significant influence on binding or infectibility on tested cells. The weak attachment of short-shafted Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors seems to be causally associated with a charge-dependent repulsion between Ad5 capsid and acidic cell surface proteins. The differences between short- and long-shafted vectors in attachment or infection were abrogated by preincubation of cells with polycations. This study demonstrates that the fiber-CAR interaction is not the sole determinant for tropism of Ad vectors containing chimeric fibers. CAR- and alphav integrin-mediated infections are influenced by other factors, including the length of the fiber shaft."

The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes metabolize xenobiotics and thus are a primary defence against these compounds. Increased expression of specific CYP genes in response to particular xenobiotics is a central component of this defence, although such induction can also increase production of toxic metabolites. Here we show that the nuclear receptor CAR mediates the response evoked by a class of xenobiotics known as the 'phenobarbital-like inducers'. The strong activation of Cyp2b10 gene expression by phenobarbital, or by the more potent TCPOBOP, is absent in mice lacking the CAR gene. These animals also show decreased metabolism of the classic CYP substrate zoxazolamine and a complete loss of the liver hypertrophic and hyperplastic responses to these inducers. Cocaine causes acute hepatotoxicity in wild-type mice previously exposed to phenobarbital-like inducers and this toxicity is also absent in the CAR-deficient animals. Thus, loss of CAR function alters sensitivity to toxins, increasing or decreasing it depending on the compound. Modulation of CAR activity in humans may significantly affect metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics."

Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease."

The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations. As could be expected, genetic differentiation (FST) was significantly correlated with physical distance, but the westernmost population (Ivory Coast) showed values that were intermediate between the central (Gabon) and Eastern (Tanzania) populations.

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

Much of this region is not irrigated, rendering soybean production systems in the area highly sensitive to in-season variations in weather. Although the influence of in-season weather trends on the yields of crops such as soybean, wheat and maize has been explored in several countries(2-6), the potentially confounding influence of genetic improvements on yields has been overlooked. Here we assess the effect of in-season weather trends on soybean yields in the United States between 1994 and 2013, using field trial data, meteorological data and information on crop management practices, including the adoption of new cultivars. We show that in-season temperature trends had a greater impact on soybean yields than in-season precipitation trends over the measurement period. Averaging across the United States, we show that soybean yields fell by around 2.4% for every 1\u2005\u00b0C rise in growing season temperature. However, the response varied significantly among individual states, ranging from -22% to +9%, and also with the month of the year in which the warming occurred. We estimate that year-to-year changes in precipitation and temperature combined suppressed the US average yield gain by around 30% over the measurement period, leading to a loss of US$11 billion. Our data highlight the importance of developing location-specific adaptation strategies for climate change based on early-, mid- and late-growing season climate trends. "

It is essentially expressed in the parathyroid glands and along the kidney nephron. The distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and connecting tubules (CNT) in the kidney are involved in active Ca(2+) reabsorption, but the function of the CaR has remained unclear in these segments. Here, the Ca(2+)-selective Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-subtype 5 channel (TRPV5) determines active Ca(2+) reabsorption by forming the apical entry gate. In this study we show that the CaR and TRPV5 co-localize at the luminal membrane of DCT/CNT. Furthermore, by patch-clamp and Fura-2-ratiometric measurements we demonstrate that activation of the CaR leads to elevated TRPV5-mediated currents and increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in cells co-expressing TRPV5 and CaR. Activation of CaR initiated a signaling cascade that activated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-insensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Importantly, mutation of two putative PKC phosphorylation sites, S299 and S654, in TRPV5 prevented the stimulatory effect of CaR activation on channel activity, as did a dominant negative CaR construct, CaR(R185Q). Interestingly, the activity of TRPV6, TRPV5' closest homologue, was not affected by the activated CaR. We conclude that activation of the CaR stimulates TRPV5-mediated Ca(2+) influx via a PMA-insensitive PKC isoform pathway."

This receptor is expressed in human glioblastoma cell line, U87, and here we show that CaR activators stimulate a Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K(+)) channel (CAKC) with a conductance of 140 pS. The responses to CaR activators, however, were blunted in U87 cells transfected with a CaR bearing an inactivating mutation (R185Q) that has previously been shown to exert a dominant negative (DN) action on the wild type receptor. Raising Ca(o) from 0.75 to 2.0 mM or addition of a polycationic CaR agonist, each activated CAKC in nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected U87 cells, while they had little or no effect on channel activity in cells expressing the DN CaR (DN-CaR cells). In nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected cells, the specific 'calcimimetic' CaR activator, NPS R-467, stimulated the channel, while its less active stereoisomer, NPS S-467, did not. In DN-CaR cells, in contrast, NPS R-467, had no effect on channel activity, suggesting defective coupling of the CaR to this ion channel. CaR-mediated stimulation of these K(+) channels could lead to membrane repolarization and related changes in cellular function under normal conditions. Since the R185Q mutation in the CaR produces a more severe phenotype in humans than most inactivating mutations of this receptor, some of its clinical consequences could potentially result from abnormal CaR-dependent channel functioning."

The initial population resulted from a balanced intercrossing of 8 inbred strains of mice. The tumors, induced by a single application of DMBA (initiation) and twice weekly applications of TPA (promotion), were benign papillomas; their number at the end of the promotion period was the phenotype chosen for assortative mating. Afterward, the majority of them regressed while others progressed to malignant carcinomas. The Car-R line was selected through a strong challenge, while the Car-S line selection was based on responses to decreasing concentrations of DMBA and TPA. The selection limit was reached after 14 or 15 generations showing progressive interline divergence, which strongly suggests the interaction of several quantitative trait loci (QTL). The phenotypic difference was extremely large: the tumor response was 73 times higher in Car-S than in Car-R mice, though the applied concentrations of DMBA and TPA were 100 and 40 times lower, respectively. The mean heritability realized during the selective breeding was 0.20 in Car-R and 0.49 in Car-S. Our results are compatible with a minimal QTL estimate of 8 in the Car-R line and of 9 or 10 in the Car-S line. The Car-S line is also much more susceptible to carcinoma induction. An association of coat color with tumorigenesis was observed in interline F2 segregants. The Car-R and Car-S lines, obtained through a long-lasting breeding program, are a unique model for identifying the QTL involved in chemical tumorigenesis and will be provided to interested investigators."

In Drosophila, Vps33A is the product of the carnation (car) gene. We generated a null allele of car to test its requirement for trafficking to different organelles. Complete loss of car function is lethal during larval development. Eye-specific loss of Car causes late, light-independent degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Earlier in these cells, two distinct phenotypes were detected. In young adults, autophagosomes amassed indicating that their fusion with lysosomes requires Car. In eye discs, endocytosed receptors and ligands accumulate in Rab7-positive prelysosomal compartments. The requirement of Car for late endosome-to-lysosome fusion in imaginal discs is specific as early endosomes are unaffected. Furthermore, lysosomal delivery is not restored by expression of dVps33B. This specificity reflects the distinct pattern of binding to different Syntaxins in vitro: dVps33B predominantly binds the early endosomal Avl and Car to dSyntaxin16. Consistent with a role in Car-mediated fusion, dSyntaxin16 is not restricted to Golgi membranes but also present on lysosomes."

The authors compared VSTM for cars among car experts and car novices. Car experts, but not car novices, demonstrated a VSTM advantage similar to that for faces; this advantage was orientation specific and was correlated with an individual's level of car expertise. Control experiments ruled out accounts based solely on verbal- or long-term memory representations.

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Major attention has been given to modification of the Ad fiber knob, which is thought to determine virus tropism. However, among the human Ad serotypes with different tissue tropisms, not only the knob but also the length of the fiber shaft domain varies significantly. In this study we attempted to delineate the role of fiber length in coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR)- and non-CAR-mediated infection. A series of Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) capsid-based vectors containing long or short fibers with knob domains derived from Ad5, Ad9, or Ad35 was constructed and tested in adsorption, internalization, and transduction studies. For Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors, a long-shafted fiber was critical for efficient adsorption/internalization and transduction of CAR/alphav integrin-expressing cells. Ad5 capids containing short CAR-recognizing fibers were affected in cell adsorption and infection. In contrast, for the chimeric vectors possessing Ad35 knobs, which enter cells by a CAR/alphav integrin-independent pathway, fiber shaft length had no significant influence on binding or infectibility on tested cells. The weak attachment of short-shafted Ad5 or Ad9 knob-possessing vectors seems to be causally associated with a charge-dependent repulsion between Ad5 capsid and acidic cell surface proteins. The differences between short- and long-shafted vectors in attachment or infection were abrogated by preincubation of cells with polycations. This study demonstrates that the fiber-CAR interaction is not the sole determinant for tropism of Ad vectors containing chimeric fibers. CAR- and alphav integrin-mediated infections are influenced by other factors, including the length of the fiber shaft."

Most weather generators focus on extreme rainfall events and rainfall amounts in a relatively short time scale. However, drought events often last more than several months, which conventional weather generators hardly generate. Conventional weather generators assume that monthly rainfalls are independent, skewing drought event generation. The purpose of this study is to construct a weather generator with improved drought property generation, combining with monthly rainfall data from conventional weather generators and characteristics of standardized precipitation indices. The proposed weather generators employs four drought parameters, namely starting month, duration, average, and minimum standardized precipitation indices, generated using a copula method. Analytical results show that the four parameters generated by the copula method are consistent with historical records. The proposed weather generator overcomes the limitation of conventional weather generators and can generate both rainfall and drought properties. The results also indicate that the assumption of monthly independence in drought generation can cause underestimated occurrence and duration of drought events. The proposed generator is also demonstrated for climate change assessment. The analytical results show that the uncertainties from the selection of weather generators are even higher than those from the selections of global circulation models while applying to water shortage assessment. We therefore suggest that weather generators should consider drought characteristics which can be measured using the standardized precipitation index to reduce the uncertainty. "

            "article": "The extracellular Ca(2+)-sensing receptor (CaR) is a key-player in plasma Ca(2+) homeostasis. It is essentially expressed in the parathyroid glands and along the kidney nephron. The distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and connecting tubules (CNT) in the kidney are involved in active Ca(2+) reabsorption, but the function of the CaR has remained unclear in these segments. Here, the Ca(2+)-selective Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid-subtype 5 channel (TRPV5) determines active Ca(2+) reabsorption by forming the apical entry gate. In this study we show that the CaR and TRPV5 co-localize at the luminal membrane of DCT/CNT. Furthermore, by patch-clamp and Fura-2-ratiometric measurements we demonstrate that activation of the CaR leads to elevated TRPV5-mediated currents and increases intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations in cells co-expressing TRPV5 and CaR. Activation of CaR initiated a signaling cascade that activated phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-insensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Importantly, mutation of two putative PKC phosphorylation sites, S299 and S654, in TRPV5 prevented the stimulatory effect of CaR activation on channel activity, as did a dominant negative CaR construct, CaR(R185Q). Interestingly, the activity of TRPV6, TRPV5' closest homologue, was not affected by the activated CaR. We conclude that activation of the CaR stimulates TRPV5-mediated Ca(2+) influx via a PMA-insensitive PKC isoform pathway."

This receptor is expressed in human glioblastoma cell line, U87, and here we show that CaR activators stimulate a Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K(+)) channel (CAKC) with a conductance of 140 pS. The responses to CaR activators, however, were blunted in U87 cells transfected with a CaR bearing an inactivating mutation (R185Q) that has previously been shown to exert a dominant negative (DN) action on the wild type receptor. Raising Ca(o) from 0.75 to 2.0 mM or addition of a polycationic CaR agonist, each activated CAKC in nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected U87 cells, while they had little or no effect on channel activity in cells expressing the DN CaR (DN-CaR cells). In nontransfected wild type and empty vector-transfected cells, the specific 'calcimimetic' CaR activator, NPS R-467, stimulated the channel, while its less active stereoisomer, NPS S-467, did not. In DN-CaR cells, in contrast, NPS R-467, had no effect on channel activity, suggesting defective coupling of the CaR to this ion channel. CaR-mediated stimulation of these K(+) channels could lead to membrane repolarization and related changes in cellular function under normal conditions. Since the R185Q mutation in the CaR produces a more severe phenotype in humans than most inactivating mutations of this receptor, some of its clinical consequences could potentially result from abnormal CaR-dependent channel functioning."

The initial population resulted from a balanced intercrossing of 8 inbred strains of mice. The tumors, induced by a single application of DMBA (initiation) and twice weekly applications of TPA (promotion), were benign papillomas; their number at the end of the promotion period was the phenotype chosen for assortative mating. Afterward, the majority of them regressed while others progressed to malignant carcinomas. The Car-R line was selected through a strong challenge, while the Car-S line selection was based on responses to decreasing concentrations of DMBA and TPA. The selection limit was reached after 14 or 15 generations showing progressive interline divergence, which strongly suggests the interaction of several quantitative trait loci (QTL). The phenotypic difference was extremely large: the tumor response was 73 times higher in Car-S than in Car-R mice, though the applied concentrations of DMBA and TPA were 100 and 40 times lower, respectively. The mean heritability realized during the selective breeding was 0.20 in Car-R and 0.49 in Car-S. Our results are compatible with a minimal QTL estimate of 8 in the Car-R line and of 9 or 10 in the Car-S line. The Car-S line is also much more susceptible to carcinoma induction. An association of coat color with tumorigenesis was observed in interline F2 segregants. The Car-R and Car-S lines, obtained through a long-lasting breeding program, are a unique model for identifying the QTL involved in chemical tumorigenesis and will be provided to interested investigators."

In Drosophila, Vps33A is the product of the carnation (car) gene. We generated a null allele of car to test its requirement for trafficking to different organelles. Complete loss of car function is lethal during larval development. Eye-specific loss of Car causes late, light-independent degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Earlier in these cells, two distinct phenotypes were detected. In young adults, autophagosomes amassed indicating that their fusion with lysosomes requires Car. In eye discs, endocytosed receptors and ligands accumulate in Rab7-positive prelysosomal compartments. The requirement of Car for late endosome-to-lysosome fusion in imaginal discs is specific as early endosomes are unaffected. Furthermore, lysosomal delivery is not restored by expression of dVps33B. This specificity reflects the distinct pattern of binding to different Syntaxins in vitro: dVps33B predominantly binds the early endosomal Avl and Car to dSyntaxin16. Consistent with a role in Car-mediated fusion, dSyntaxin16 is not restricted to Golgi membranes but also present on lysosomes."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease that is also accompanied by hippocampal atrophy, and therefore can serve as a model for ascertaining the relationship between CAR and hippocampal volume. We contrasted a group of 18 individuals with T2DM with 12 matched controls on MRI-based hippocampal volume and salivary diurnal cortisol profile including CAR. Individuals with T2DM had smaller hippocampal volumes and exhibited a blunting of the CAR relative to controls, while diurnal cortisol was not affected. Across all subjects, fasting insulin and hippocampal volume were associated with the CAR, independent of diagnosis. Our findings support the hypothesis that hippocampal integrity is an important predictor of the CAR."

Its capacity, however, is greater for faces than for other objects; this advantage may stem from the holistic nature of face processing. If the holistic processing explains this advantage, object expertise--which also relies on holistic processing--should endow experts with a VSTM advantage. The authors compared VSTM for cars among car experts and car novices. Car experts, but not car novices, demonstrated a VSTM advantage similar to that for faces; this advantage was orientation specific and was correlated with an individual's level of car expertise. Control experiments ruled out accounts based solely on verbal- or long-term memory representations. These findings suggest that the processing advantages afforded by visual expertise result in domain-specific increases in VSTM capacity, perhaps by allowing experts to maximize the use of an inherently limited VSTM system."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease."
