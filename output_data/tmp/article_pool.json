The cover fits all bags and is practical for use whether the golf bag (24) is placed on a hand cart, electric or gas cart, or hand carried by a strap (26). This golf bag cover can be manufactured cheaply and simply."

If an abnormality is detected during driving wheel slip control, an amount of reduction in output of the driving wheels is set to a predetermined amount to thereby continue driving wheel slip control, until the prime mover enters an operating condition other than acceleration. Further, the system comprises first and second control units. The latter informs the former of three states for determining whether or not driving wheel slip control can be carried out. The first control unit has the slip level signal-generating device and the slip status signal-generating device, and inhibition of operation of these devices is retarded when it is informed of a state inhibiting driving wheel slip control, if an excessive slip state of the driving wheels is occurring."

When not folded flat, this equilateral tee box opens to form a diamond wedge which may be aimed in the desired direction of flight when teeing up. The base perimeter of the wedge, interrupted by a serration on each side, will hug the ground surface while the upper perimeter seats the ball, whose weight bolsters upright stability. One of these fully-opened tees, serving as a retaining band, will bundle into a six-pack, up to five of these different sized, collapsed tees when not in playing use."
