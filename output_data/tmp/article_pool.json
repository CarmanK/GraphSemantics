In this study, we examined the expression of Cav-1 in 34 human PDAC tissue samples and the associated peritumoral tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001). Based on the results of this study, the inclusion of Cav-1 in a putative panel of biomarkers predicting pancreatic cancer aggressiveness is warranted."

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

In ventral but not lateral LOC, a linear recovery from adaptation proportional to shape dissimilarity was seen. In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC. Further, ventral LOC voxels were found to be broadly tuned and represent all aspects of stimulus similarity, whereas lateral LOC voxels were narrowly tuned and preferentially represented the shape of small features rather than their orientation within the shape. The results, indicating a coarse spatial coding of shape features in lateral LOC and a more focused coding of the entire shape space within ventral LOC, may be related to hierarchical models of object processing."

The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease."

This study describes the trunk motion and paraspinal muscle activity during the swing of a golfer with related low back pain (LBP) and assesses the effect of a 3-month period of muscle conditioning and coaching on these variables. Motion of the trunk was measured using three-dimensional video analysis and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the same six sites of the erector spinae at the start and end of the 3-month period. At the end of the period, the golfer was able to play and practice without LBP. Coaching resulted in an increase in the range of hip turn and a decrease in the amount of shoulder turn, which occurred during the swing. In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae. These changes may serve to reduce the torsional and compressive loads acting on the thoracic and lumbar spine, which in turn may have contributed to the cessation of the LBP and would reduce the risk of reoccurrence in the future.

Five noncontiguous rain forest sites (from Tanzania, Gabon and Ivory Coast) were sampled to measure the effects of historical forest fragmentation on population structure in an obligatory forest-dwelling species. The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations. As could be expected, genetic differentiation (FST) was significantly correlated with physical distance, but the westernmost population (Ivory Coast) showed values that were intermediate between the central (Gabon) and Eastern (Tanzania) populations. A migration-drift equilibrium in a stable continuum of populations did not appear adequate to describe the observed distribution. It seems probable that the species has undergone abrupt changes involving isolation, merging and migration of populations, as a consequence of repeated waves of forest fragmentation and coalescence."

Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the GhGA20ox1 gene was expressed in the transgenic plants at various levels. It was demonstrated that overexpression of GhGA20ox1 enhanced preferentially the GA(4+7) biosynthesis in N. benthamiana and conferred GA-overproduction characters to transformants. The extent of phenotypic alteration in the transgenic plants was found to correlate with the transcriptional levels of GhGA20ox1 and GA contents. Results indicated that the GhGA20ox1 gene promoted the biosynthesis of the active GAs (GA(4+7)) in transgenic tobacco plants therefore represents a useful gene for manipulating GA levels."

Ninety-two magnetocardiograms of singletons with normal courses of pregnancy between 24 + 1 and 41 + 6 wks GA were studied. Heart rate patterns were either quiet/non-accelerative (fHRP I) or active/accelerative (fHRP II) and recording quality sufficient for fHRV. The sample was divided into the GA groups <32 wks GA/>32 wks GA. Linear parameters of fHRV were calculated: mean heart rate (mHR), SDNN and RMSSD of normal-to-normal interbeat intervals, power in the low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency range (0.15-0.4 Hz) and the ratios SDNN/RMSSD and LF/HF as markers for sympatho-vagal balance. fHRP I is characterized by decreasing SDNN/RMSSD, LF/HF and mHR. The decrease is more pronounced <32 wks GA. Beyond that GA SDNN/RMSSD is predominantly determined by RMSSD during fHRP I and by SDNN during fHRP II. In contrast to fHRP I, during fHRP II, mHR is positively correlated to SDNN/RMSSD instead of SDNN >32 wks GA. LF/HF increases in fHRP II during the first half of the third trimester. Non-accelerative fHRP are indicative of parasympathetic dominance >32 wks GA. In contrast, the sympathetic accentuation during accelerative fHRP is displayed in the interrelations between mHR, SDNN and SDNN/RMSSD. Prior to 32 wks GA, fHRV reveals the increasing activity of the respective branches of the autonomic nervous system differentiating the types of fHRP."

In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae.

Diabetes is one of most difficult challenges facing the healthcare industry today. One of the primary afflictions of diabetic patients is peripheral neuropathy (loss of sensation in the foot). As a direct result of this condition, the likelihood of ulcer increases which in many cases leads to to amputation. We have developed a wireless electronic orthotics composed of lightweight embedded systems and non-invasive sensors which can be used by diabetic patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy. Our proposed system monitors feet motion and pressure distribution beneath the feet in real-time and classifies the state of the patient. The proposed system detects the conditions that could potentially cause a foot ulcer. This system enables a continuous feedback mechanism for instance in case of an undesired behavior or condition a preemptive message wirelessly to the patient and the patient's caregiver."

One of the most widely employed strategies for assessing social skill has been role-play tests: simulated social interactions that are videotaped for subsequent behavioral coding. There has been considerable discussion of the validity of the approach in the literature, but there has not been adequate consideration of other psychometric characteristics of role-play tests. This paper examines the psychometric characteristics of a representative role-play measure: the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC). Data from 5 large schizophrenia studies that included the MASC were examined: a study of victimization in women who abuse drugs, a study of health care among people with diabetes, a study of vocational outcomes, a study of social skill among drug abusers, and a clinical trial comparing two antipsychotic medications. Data were examined in terms of five questions: (1) Can role-play scenes be rated reliably? (2) How are role-play ratings distributed across populations? (3) How many and which behaviors should be rated? (4) How many role-play scenes are required? (5) Is role-play behavior temporally stable? Overall, the data suggest that the MASC, and by implication other similar role-play procedures, does have good psychometric properties. However, several things often taken for granted in the literature warrant careful consideration in the design of research using role-play. Implications of the results for design of research are discussed."

Changes in substitutive and inventive actions were, however, more minor than expected. Single-scheme combinations did not reveal any essential aspect of the development of children's symbolic competence. In this sense, multischeme combinations were more important in revealing the children's way of organizing toy material. Linear age trends were not found for language measures.

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Tree cover typically retained in agricultural landscapes in the neotropics may provide resources and habitats for animals, but little is known about the extent to which it contributes to conservation of animal species. Here, we explore the animal diversity associated with different forms of tree cover for birds, bats, butterflies, and dung beetles in a pastoral landscape in Nicaragua. We measured species richness and abundance of these four animal taxa in riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, live fences, and pastures with high and low tree cover. We recorded over 20,000 individuals of 189 species including 14 endangered bird species. Mean abundance and species richness of birds and bats, but not dung beetles or butterflies, were significantly different among forms of tree cover. Species richness of bats and birds was positively correlated with tree species richness. While the greatest numbers of bird species were associated with riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, and pastures with >15% tree cover, the greatest numbers of bat species were found in live fences and riparian forest. Species assemblages of all animal taxa were different among tree cover types, so that maintaining a diversity of forms of tree cover led to conservation of more animal species in the landscape as a whole. Overall, the findings indicate that retaining tree cover within agricultural landscapes can help conserve animal diversity, but that conservation efforts need to target forms of tree cover that conserve the taxa that are of interest locally. Preventing the degradation of remaining forest fragments is a priority, but encouraging farmers to maintain tree cover in pastures and along boundaries may also make an important contribution to animal conservation."

Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005).

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

New studies on many different viruses have shown that virus attachment and cell entry is often a multistep process, requiring many interactions between the virus and cell surface molecules. In this study, we have attempted to identify the cell surface molecules involved in Coxsackievirus A9 (CAV-9), a common human pathogen and a member of the Picornavirus family, infectious process. GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical. The role of MAP-70 in CAV-9 infectious process is discussed."

The third group served as unvaccinated controls. All vaccinated dogs subsequently developed serum antibody titers to Bb that persisted for at least 1 year. Following Bb challenge 1 year after vaccination, all vaccinated dogs, regardless of group, showed significantly fewer clinical signs and shed significantly fewer challenge organisms than unvaccinated controls.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that IBV contained in chicken lachrymal fluid is infectious and that tears of IBV-infected chickens can be used to infect naive chickens. We compared the immune responses to IBV in the Harderian gland and cecal tonsils of immunocompetent chickens and chickens infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocytes in Harderian glands and cecal tonsils indicated that the relative abundance of IgM+ B cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils following exposure to IBV in combination with immunosuppressive viruses was reduced compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. CAV, but not IBDV, reduced the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. Enzyme-linked immuno-spot forming assays on cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils of IBV-infected chickens indicated that maximum IBV-specific IgA-secreting cell responses were reduced in chickens infected with CAV. IBDV co-infected chickens displayed a delayed IgA response to IBV. Thus immunosuppressive viruses reduced B cells and T helper cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils in response to IBV, and slowed the kinetics and/or reduced the magnitude of the mucosal immune response against IBV. We have shown for the first time that CAV affects pathogen-specific B cell responses in a mucosal effector site."

In ventral but not lateral LOC, a linear recovery from adaptation proportional to shape dissimilarity was seen. In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC. Further, ventral LOC voxels were found to be broadly tuned and represent all aspects of stimulus similarity, whereas lateral LOC voxels were narrowly tuned and preferentially represented the shape of small features rather than their orientation within the shape. The results, indicating a coarse spatial coding of shape features in lateral LOC and a more focused coding of the entire shape space within ventral LOC, may be related to hierarchical models of object processing."

This study describes the trunk motion and paraspinal muscle activity during the swing of a golfer with related low back pain (LBP) and assesses the effect of a 3-month period of muscle conditioning and coaching on these variables. Motion of the trunk was measured using three-dimensional video analysis and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the same six sites of the erector spinae at the start and end of the 3-month period. At the end of the period, the golfer was able to play and practice without LBP. Coaching resulted in an increase in the range of hip turn and a decrease in the amount of shoulder turn, which occurred during the swing. In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae. These changes may serve to reduce the torsional and compressive loads acting on the thoracic and lumbar spine, which in turn may have contributed to the cessation of the LBP and would reduce the risk of reoccurrence in the future. In conclusion, further research with more subjects would now be warranted in order to test the findings of this program for the prevention of low back in golfers as piloted in this case report."

The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations. As could be expected, genetic differentiation (FST) was significantly correlated with physical distance, but the westernmost population (Ivory Coast) showed values that were intermediate between the central (Gabon) and Eastern (Tanzania) populations. A migration-drift equilibrium in a stable continuum of populations did not appear adequate to describe the observed distribution.

In this study, we examined the expression of Cav-1 in 34 human PDAC tissue samples and the associated peritumoral tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001). Based on the results of this study, the inclusion of Cav-1 in a putative panel of biomarkers predicting pancreatic cancer aggressiveness is warranted."

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

New studies on many different viruses have shown that virus attachment and cell entry is often a multistep process, requiring many interactions between the virus and cell surface molecules. In this study, we have attempted to identify the cell surface molecules involved in Coxsackievirus A9 (CAV-9), a common human pathogen and a member of the Picornavirus family, infectious process. GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical. The role of MAP-70 in CAV-9 infectious process is discussed."

The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations. As could be expected, genetic differentiation (FST) was significantly correlated with physical distance, but the westernmost population (Ivory Coast) showed values that were intermediate between the central (Gabon) and Eastern (Tanzania) populations.

Following Bb challenge 1 year after vaccination, all vaccinated dogs, regardless of group, showed significantly fewer clinical signs and shed significantly fewer challenge organisms than unvaccinated controls.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that IBV contained in chicken lachrymal fluid is infectious and that tears of IBV-infected chickens can be used to infect naive chickens. We compared the immune responses to IBV in the Harderian gland and cecal tonsils of immunocompetent chickens and chickens infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocytes in Harderian glands and cecal tonsils indicated that the relative abundance of IgM+ B cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils following exposure to IBV in combination with immunosuppressive viruses was reduced compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. CAV, but not IBDV, reduced the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. Enzyme-linked immuno-spot forming assays on cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils of IBV-infected chickens indicated that maximum IBV-specific IgA-secreting cell responses were reduced in chickens infected with CAV. IBDV co-infected chickens displayed a delayed IgA response to IBV. Thus immunosuppressive viruses reduced B cells and T helper cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils in response to IBV, and slowed the kinetics and/or reduced the magnitude of the mucosal immune response against IBV. We have shown for the first time that CAV affects pathogen-specific B cell responses in a mucosal effector site."

In ventral but not lateral LOC, a linear recovery from adaptation proportional to shape dissimilarity was seen. In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC. Further, ventral LOC voxels were found to be broadly tuned and represent all aspects of stimulus similarity, whereas lateral LOC voxels were narrowly tuned and preferentially represented the shape of small features rather than their orientation within the shape. The results, indicating a coarse spatial coding of shape features in lateral LOC and a more focused coding of the entire shape space within ventral LOC, may be related to hierarchical models of object processing."

The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease."

Inspired by the joint architectures in the human body, where small amounts of soft cartilage connect stiff (or hard) but hollow (and thus lightweight) bones, the 3D internetworked GA@PDMS achieves synergistic toughening. The resulting GA@PDMS nanocomposites exhibit fully reversible structural deformations (99.8% recovery even at a 90% compressive strain) and high compressive mechanical strength (448.2 kPa at a compressive strain of 90%) at repeated compression cycles. Owing to the combination of excellent mechanical and electrical properties, the GA@PDMS nanocomposites are used as signal transducers for strain sensors, showing very short response and recovery times (in the millisecond range) with reliable sensitivity and extreme durability. Furthermore, the proposed system is applied to electronic scales with a large detectable weight of about 4600 times greater than its own weight.

Over the years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the regulation of GA signalling and metabolism, which ensures appropriate levels of GAs for growth and development(2). Moreover, an additional level of regulation may reside in the transport of GAs from production sites to recipient tissues that require GAs for growth. Although there is considerable evidence suggesting the existence of short- and long-distance movement of GAs in plants(3-8), the nature and the biological properties of this transport are not yet understood. Here, we combine biochemical and conventional micrografting experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana to show that the GA precursor GA12, although biologically inactive by itself, is the major mobile GA signal over long distances. Quantitative analysis of endogenous GAs in xylem and phloem exudates further indicates that GA12 moves through the plant vascular system. Finally, we demonstrate that GA12 is functional in recipient tissues, supporting growth via the activation of the GA signalling cascade. Collectively, these results reveal the existence of long-range transport of endogenous GA12 in plants that may have implications for the control of developmental phase transitions and the adaptation to adverse environments.

SFVS was used to investigate the effect of gA on lipid flip-flop in a planar 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) lipid bilayer. The kinetics of lipid translocation were determined by an analysis of the SFVS intensity versus time at different temperatures in the presence of 2 mol % gA. The rate constants of DSPC flip-flop increase from 2 to 10 times relative to the pure DSPC system. The results indicate that facial lipid exchange can be induced by a hydrophobic transmembrane helix. The increase in lipid flip-flop rates is correlated to an increase in the gauche content of the lipid tails. The results suggest that membrane defects induced by the presence of integral membrane proteins may play a large role in modulating the rate of lipid flip-flop."

We have shown that fetal rat astrocytes in primary culture secrete cholesterol-rich HDL with the endogenous apolipoprotein (apo) E and generate cholesterol-poor HDL with exogenous apoE and apoA-I [Ito et al. (1999) J. Neurochem. 72, 2362]. In order to study these reactions in relation to the stage of cell differentiation, we examined generation of HDL by rat astrocytoma cells. Lack of apoE secretion was found in three astrocytoma cell lines, human T98G, rat C6, and GA-1 [Kano-Tanaka et al. (1986) Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B 62, 109]. GA-1 produced apoE at very low level and therefore generated much less HDL by itself than the astrocytes in primary culture. In contrast, GA-1 interacted with exogenous apoE and apoA-I to produce cholesterol-rich HDL while the astrocytes produced cholesterol-poor HDL with these apolipoproteins. Cholesterol biosynthesis rate measured from mevalonate was higher and down-regulated more by LDL in the astrocytes than GA-1. On the other hand, the cellular cholesterol level, uptake of LDL, and cyclodextrin-mediated non-specific diffusion of cholesterol from cell surface were same between these two cells. Treatment of GA-1 with acidic fibroblast growth factor influenced neither the production of apoE nor the baseline lipid secretion, but increased the cholesterol synthesis from mevalonate and the magnitude of its down-regulation by LDL, and decreased cholesterol content in the HDL produced by exogenous apoA-I. In conclusion, suppression of apoE biosynthesis in the undifferentiated astrocytes GA-1 resulted in poor secretion of cholesterol-rich HDL and in turn more production of HDL with exogenous apolipoprotein. Cellular cholesterol homeostasis was altered accordingly."

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

New studies on many different viruses have shown that virus attachment and cell entry is often a multistep process, requiring many interactions between the virus and cell surface molecules. In this study, we have attempted to identify the cell surface molecules involved in Coxsackievirus A9 (CAV-9), a common human pathogen and a member of the Picornavirus family, infectious process. GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical. The role of MAP-70 in CAV-9 infectious process is discussed."

In ventral but not lateral LOC, a linear recovery from adaptation proportional to shape dissimilarity was seen. In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC. Further, ventral LOC voxels were found to be broadly tuned and represent all aspects of stimulus similarity, whereas lateral LOC voxels were narrowly tuned and preferentially represented the shape of small features rather than their orientation within the shape. The results, indicating a coarse spatial coding of shape features in lateral LOC and a more focused coding of the entire shape space within ventral LOC, may be related to hierarchical models of object processing."

It was demonstrated that overexpression of GhGA20ox1 enhanced preferentially the GA(4+7) biosynthesis in N. benthamiana and conferred GA-overproduction characters to transformants. The extent of phenotypic alteration in the transgenic plants was found to correlate with the transcriptional levels of GhGA20ox1 and GA contents.

Ninety-two magnetocardiograms of singletons with normal courses of pregnancy between 24 + 1 and 41 + 6 wks GA were studied. Heart rate patterns were either quiet/non-accelerative (fHRP I) or active/accelerative (fHRP II) and recording quality sufficient for fHRV. The sample was divided into the GA groups <32 wks GA/>32 wks GA. Linear parameters of fHRV were calculated: mean heart rate (mHR), SDNN and RMSSD of normal-to-normal interbeat intervals, power in the low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency range (0.15-0.4 Hz) and the ratios SDNN/RMSSD and LF/HF as markers for sympatho-vagal balance. fHRP I is characterized by decreasing SDNN/RMSSD, LF/HF and mHR. The decrease is more pronounced <32 wks GA. Beyond that GA SDNN/RMSSD is predominantly determined by RMSSD during fHRP I and by SDNN during fHRP II. In contrast to fHRP I, during fHRP II, mHR is positively correlated to SDNN/RMSSD instead of SDNN >32 wks GA. LF/HF increases in fHRP II during the first half of the third trimester. Non-accelerative fHRP are indicative of parasympathetic dominance >32 wks GA. In contrast, the sympathetic accentuation during accelerative fHRP is displayed in the interrelations between mHR, SDNN and SDNN/RMSSD. Prior to 32 wks GA, fHRV reveals the increasing activity of the respective branches of the autonomic nervous system differentiating the types of fHRP."

One of the most widely employed strategies for assessing social skill has been role-play tests: simulated social interactions that are videotaped for subsequent behavioral coding. There has been considerable discussion of the validity of the approach in the literature, but there has not been adequate consideration of other psychometric characteristics of role-play tests. This paper examines the psychometric characteristics of a representative role-play measure: the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC). Data from 5 large schizophrenia studies that included the MASC were examined: a study of victimization in women who abuse drugs, a study of health care among people with diabetes, a study of vocational outcomes, a study of social skill among drug abusers, and a clinical trial comparing two antipsychotic medications. Data were examined in terms of five questions: (1) Can role-play scenes be rated reliably? (2) How are role-play ratings distributed across populations? (3) How many and which behaviors should be rated? (4) How many role-play scenes are required? (5) Is role-play behavior temporally stable? Overall, the data suggest that the MASC, and by implication other similar role-play procedures, does have good psychometric properties. However, several things often taken for granted in the literature warrant careful consideration in the design of research using role-play. Implications of the results for design of research are discussed."

Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Tree cover typically retained in agricultural landscapes in the neotropics may provide resources and habitats for animals, but little is known about the extent to which it contributes to conservation of animal species. Here, we explore the animal diversity associated with different forms of tree cover for birds, bats, butterflies, and dung beetles in a pastoral landscape in Nicaragua. We measured species richness and abundance of these four animal taxa in riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, live fences, and pastures with high and low tree cover. We recorded over 20,000 individuals of 189 species including 14 endangered bird species. Mean abundance and species richness of birds and bats, but not dung beetles or butterflies, were significantly different among forms of tree cover. Species richness of bats and birds was positively correlated with tree species richness. While the greatest numbers of bird species were associated with riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, and pastures with >15% tree cover, the greatest numbers of bat species were found in live fences and riparian forest. Species assemblages of all animal taxa were different among tree cover types, so that maintaining a diversity of forms of tree cover led to conservation of more animal species in the landscape as a whole. Overall, the findings indicate that retaining tree cover within agricultural landscapes can help conserve animal diversity, but that conservation efforts need to target forms of tree cover that conserve the taxa that are of interest locally. Preventing the degradation of remaining forest fragments is a priority, but encouraging farmers to maintain tree cover in pastures and along boundaries may also make an important contribution to animal conservation."

Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001). Based on the results of this study, the inclusion of Cav-1 in a putative panel of biomarkers predicting pancreatic cancer aggressiveness is warranted."

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions.

We compared the immune responses to IBV in the Harderian gland and cecal tonsils of immunocompetent chickens and chickens infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocytes in Harderian glands and cecal tonsils indicated that the relative abundance of IgM+ B cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils following exposure to IBV in combination with immunosuppressive viruses was reduced compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. CAV, but not IBDV, reduced the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. Enzyme-linked immuno-spot forming assays on cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils of IBV-infected chickens indicated that maximum IBV-specific IgA-secreting cell responses were reduced in chickens infected with CAV. IBDV co-infected chickens displayed a delayed IgA response to IBV. Thus immunosuppressive viruses reduced B cells and T helper cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils in response to IBV, and slowed the kinetics and/or reduced the magnitude of the mucosal immune response against IBV.

Advances in wireless technology and embedded systems have enabled remote healthcare and telemedicine. Continuous and real-time monitoring can discretely analyze how a patient's lifestyle affects his/her physiological conditions and if additional symptoms occur under various stimuli. Diabetes is one of most difficult challenges facing the healthcare industry today. One of the primary afflictions of diabetic patients is peripheral neuropathy (loss of sensation in the foot). As a direct result of this condition, the likelihood of ulcer increases which in many cases leads to to amputation. We have developed a wireless electronic orthotics composed of lightweight embedded systems and non-invasive sensors which can be used by diabetic patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy. Our proposed system monitors feet motion and pressure distribution beneath the feet in real-time and classifies the state of the patient. The proposed system detects the conditions that could potentially cause a foot ulcer. This system enables a continuous feedback mechanism for instance in case of an undesired behavior or condition a preemptive message wirelessly to the patient and the patient's caregiver."

Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

In this study, we examined the expression of Cav-1 in 34 human PDAC tissue samples and the associated peritumoral tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001). Based on the results of this study, the inclusion of Cav-1 in a putative panel of biomarkers predicting pancreatic cancer aggressiveness is warranted."

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Advances in wireless technology and embedded systems have enabled remote healthcare and telemedicine. Continuous and real-time monitoring can discretely analyze how a patient's lifestyle affects his/her physiological conditions and if additional symptoms occur under various stimuli. Diabetes is one of most difficult challenges facing the healthcare industry today. One of the primary afflictions of diabetic patients is peripheral neuropathy (loss of sensation in the foot). As a direct result of this condition, the likelihood of ulcer increases which in many cases leads to to amputation. We have developed a wireless electronic orthotics composed of lightweight embedded systems and non-invasive sensors which can be used by diabetic patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy. Our proposed system monitors feet motion and pressure distribution beneath the feet in real-time and classifies the state of the patient. The proposed system detects the conditions that could potentially cause a foot ulcer. This system enables a continuous feedback mechanism for instance in case of an undesired behavior or condition a preemptive message wirelessly to the patient and the patient's caregiver."

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Tree cover typically retained in agricultural landscapes in the neotropics may provide resources and habitats for animals, but little is known about the extent to which it contributes to conservation of animal species. Here, we explore the animal diversity associated with different forms of tree cover for birds, bats, butterflies, and dung beetles in a pastoral landscape in Nicaragua. We measured species richness and abundance of these four animal taxa in riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, live fences, and pastures with high and low tree cover. We recorded over 20,000 individuals of 189 species including 14 endangered bird species. Mean abundance and species richness of birds and bats, but not dung beetles or butterflies, were significantly different among forms of tree cover. Species richness of bats and birds was positively correlated with tree species richness. While the greatest numbers of bird species were associated with riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, and pastures with >15% tree cover, the greatest numbers of bat species were found in live fences and riparian forest. Species assemblages of all animal taxa were different among tree cover types, so that maintaining a diversity of forms of tree cover led to conservation of more animal species in the landscape as a whole. Overall, the findings indicate that retaining tree cover within agricultural landscapes can help conserve animal diversity, but that conservation efforts need to target forms of tree cover that conserve the taxa that are of interest locally. Preventing the degradation of remaining forest fragments is a priority, but encouraging farmers to maintain tree cover in pastures and along boundaries may also make an important contribution to animal conservation."

Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001). Based on the results of this study, the inclusion of Cav-1 in a putative panel of biomarkers predicting pancreatic cancer aggressiveness is warranted."

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

We compared the immune responses to IBV in the Harderian gland and cecal tonsils of immunocompetent chickens and chickens infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocytes in Harderian glands and cecal tonsils indicated that the relative abundance of IgM+ B cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils following exposure to IBV in combination with immunosuppressive viruses was reduced compared to chickens infected with IBV alone.

In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC.

Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

New studies on many different viruses have shown that virus attachment and cell entry is often a multistep process, requiring many interactions between the virus and cell surface molecules. In this study, we have attempted to identify the cell surface molecules involved in Coxsackievirus A9 (CAV-9), a common human pathogen and a member of the Picornavirus family, infectious process. GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical.

Following Bb challenge 1 year after vaccination, all vaccinated dogs, regardless of group, showed significantly fewer clinical signs and shed significantly fewer challenge organisms than unvaccinated controls.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that IBV contained in chicken lachrymal fluid is infectious and that tears of IBV-infected chickens can be used to infect naive chickens. We compared the immune responses to IBV in the Harderian gland and cecal tonsils of immunocompetent chickens and chickens infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocytes in Harderian glands and cecal tonsils indicated that the relative abundance of IgM+ B cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils following exposure to IBV in combination with immunosuppressive viruses was reduced compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. CAV, but not IBDV, reduced the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. Enzyme-linked immuno-spot forming assays on cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils of IBV-infected chickens indicated that maximum IBV-specific IgA-secreting cell responses were reduced in chickens infected with CAV. IBDV co-infected chickens displayed a delayed IgA response to IBV. Thus immunosuppressive viruses reduced B cells and T helper cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils in response to IBV, and slowed the kinetics and/or reduced the magnitude of the mucosal immune response against IBV. We have shown for the first time that CAV affects pathogen-specific B cell responses in a mucosal effector site."

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on sediment and P export from pastured riparian areas under simulated rainfall events. Plots were established on two sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: a 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) and a 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults), both with mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

In this review, we will discuss how carbon nanomaterials \"on-board\" of micromotors offer particular promise for diverse LOC applications. New trends in the field, directed towards the use of quantum dots and nanoparticles as functional materials for sophisticated micromotors, will be reviewed. Micromotor strategies using functionalized catalytic microengines to capture and transport (bio)molecules between the different reservoirs of LOC devices will also be covered. These recent advances are bringing closer our hopes for personalized medicine and food safety assurance, among others. "

            "article": "The best-characterized receptors for adenoviruses (Ads) are the coxsackievirus-Ad receptor (CAR) and integrins alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3), which facilitate entry. The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

            "article": "One of the major categories of disease-causing micro-organisms are viruses. New studies on many different viruses have shown that virus attachment and cell entry is often a multistep process, requiring many interactions between the virus and cell surface molecules. In this study, we have attempted to identify the cell surface molecules involved in Coxsackievirus A9 (CAV-9), a common human pathogen and a member of the Picornavirus family, infectious process. GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical. The role of MAP-70 in CAV-9 infectious process is discussed."

One group was vaccinated with a single dose of monovalent attenuated Bb vaccine and one group with a trivalent vaccine containing attenuated Bb, CPI, and CAV-2; dogs were vaccinated intranasally with a single dose of the respective vaccines. The third group served as unvaccinated controls. All vaccinated dogs subsequently developed serum antibody titers to Bb that persisted for at least 1 year. Following Bb challenge 1 year after vaccination, all vaccinated dogs, regardless of group, showed significantly fewer clinical signs and shed significantly fewer challenge organisms than unvaccinated controls. These results demonstrate that intranasal administration of a single dose of monovalent attenuated Bb vaccine or trivalent vaccine containing attenuated Bb, CPI, and CAV-2 provides 1 year of protection against Bb."
