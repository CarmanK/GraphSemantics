MPT-free human sulfite oxidase apoprotein was obtained by heterologous expression in an Escherichia coli mutant with a defect in the early steps of MPT biosynthesis. In vitro reconstitution of the purified apoprotein was achieved using an incubation mixture containing purified precursor Z, purified MPT synthase, and sodium molybdate. In vitro synthesized MPT generated from precursor Z by MPT synthase remains bound to the synthase. Surprisingly, MPT synthase was found capable of donating bound MPT to MPT-free sulfite oxidase. MPT was not released from MPT synthase when either bovine serum albumin or Moco-containing sulfite oxidase was used in place of aposulfite oxidase. After the inclusion of sodium molybdate in the reconstitution mixture, active sulfite oxidase was obtained, revealing that in vitro MPT synthase and aposulfite oxidase are sufficient for the insertion of MPT into sulfite oxidase and the conversion of MPT into Moco in the presence of high concentrations of molybdate. The conversion of MPT into Moco by molybdate chelation apparently occurs concomitantly with the insertion of MPT into sulfite oxidase."

Tyrosine 43 is positioned parallel to the fifth heme axial ligand, His34, of heme 1 in the tetraheme cytochrome c(3). The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics. The mutation of Y43L, however, did not induce a significant change in the crystal structure."

Complexation between folic acid (FA) and a typical PAH, anthracene, was investigated using FTIR and UV spectra. Appearance of a new IR band at 2362cm(-1) demonstrates that NH(2)-CN(1)- moiety on pterin (PT) ring in FA is protonated when anthracene is introduced. The shift of the characteristic IR band of the PT ring and the emergence of two charge transfer bands at 254nm and 246nm in UV difference spectra show the presence of pi-pi complexation between folic acid and anthracene. These experiments confirm that anthracene could combine with the pterin ring of folic acid through pi-pi donor-acceptor interaction (EDA) and induce the protonation process in FA upon strengthening electron accepting ability of PT ring."

Current strength susceptibilities have been obtained by numerically integrating separately the diatropic and paratropic contributions to the current flow passing planes through chosen bonds of the molecules. The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2. The calculated current patterns elucidate why the compounds with formally [4n + 2] \u03c0-electrons have unusual aromatic properties violating the H\u00fcckel \u03c0-electron count rule. The current density calculations also provide valuable information for interpreting the measured (1)H NMR spectra. "

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine their affinity and selectivity are correspondingly important. Herein, we have determined the relative strengths of intramolecular interactions between a series of monosaccharides and an aromatic ring close to the glycosylation site in an N-glycoprotein host. We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars. Galactose seems to make the weakest and allose the strongest sugar-aromatic interactions, with glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in between. The NMR solution structures of several of the monosaccharide-containing N-glycoproteins were solved to further understand the origins of the similarities and differences between the monosaccharide-aromatic interaction energies. Peracetylation of the monosaccharides substantially increases the strength of the sugar-aromatic interaction in the context of our N-glycoprotein host. Finally, we discuss our results in light of recent literature regarding the contribution of electrostatics to CH-\u03c0 interactions and speculate on what our observations imply about the absolute conservation of GlcNAc as the monosaccharide through which N-linked glycans are attached to glycoproteins in eukaryotes.

These occur both within repeating elements of secondary structure and in tertiary and quaternary interactions. It has been suggested that they are important in protein folding and stability, and non-bonded potential energy calculations indicate that a typical aromatic-aromatic interaction has an energy of between -1 and -2 kcal/mol and contributes between -0.6 and -1.3 kcal/mol to protein stability. There is such an aromatic pair on the solvent-exposed face of the first alpha-helix of barnase, the small ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The edge of the aromatic ring of Tyr17 interacts with the face of that of Tyr13. The two residues have been mutated both singly and pairwise to alanine, and their free energies of unfolding determined by denaturation with urea. Application of the double-mutant cycle analysis gives an interaction energy of -1.3 kcal/mol for the aromatic pair in the folded protein relative to solvation by water in the unfolded protein. This value is similar to that calculated from the change in surface-accessible area between the rings on the formation of the pair. Analysis of a further double-mutant cycle in which the Tyr residues are mutated to Phe indicates that the aromatic-aromatic interactions of Tyr/Tyr and Phe/Phe make identical contributions to protein stability. However, Tyr is preferred to Phe by 0.3(+/- 0.04) kcal/mol at the solvent-exposed face of the alpha-helix."

This has some limitations because copper concentration in plasma fluctuates with age, exercise and health status and does not increase after a meal nor decrease during short-term fasting. The Austrian Study on Nutritional Status (ASNS) provides data on nutrient intake and corresponding plasma concentrations, permitting to evaluate the suitability of copper plasma concentration as a marker of copper intake. Copper intake and intake of relevant nutrients and food groups were evaluated from 7-day weighed food records from 2,400 preschool and schoolchildren between 4 and 19 years of age. Blood samples were collected from a subgroup of 1,400 of these children. The copper concentration in plasma was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Correlations between plasma concentrations and intake of nutrients and food groups were calculated using a stepwise linear regression model. The results showed that the determination of copper plasma concentrations are inadequate to predict copper intake from dietary records. A better indicator for copper supply may be the evaluation of those food items, which are the predominant sources of copper intake at the population level. The highest influence on copper plasma concentration was found for the intake of meat, representing not only the most important food group for copper supply but also the most important food group for fat and protein supply.

These studies revealed that the ycnJ gene encodes a protein that plays an important role in copper metabolism, as it shows a significant, eightfold upregulation under copper-limiting conditions and its disruption causes a growth-defective phenotype under copper deprivation as well as a reduced intracellular content of copper. Native gel shift experiments with the periplasmic N-terminal domain of the YcnJ membrane protein (135 residues) disclosed its strong affinity to Cu(II) ions in vitro. Inspection of the upstream sequence of ycnJ revealed that the ycnK gene encodes a putative transcriptional regulator, whose deletion caused an elevated expression of ycnJ, especially under conditions of copper excess. Further studies demonstrated that the recently identified copper efflux regulator CsoR also is involved in the regulation of ycnJ expression, leading to a new model for copper homeostasis in B. subtilis."

Twelve weeks of copper loading resulted in a 32-fold increase in total hepatic copper. TETREN was the most effective chelator in increasing the urinary excretion of copper. However, it did not reduce significantly the hepatic copper levels. In turn, combined administration of zinc and chelating agents significantly reduced the amount of copper found in the feces.

The assay is based on the reaction of o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) and ammonium chloride with the analyte in basic medium under SI conditions. Upon on-line alkalization with NaOH, a blue product is formed having an absorption maximum at 630 nm. The parameters affecting the reaction - temperature, pH, ionic strength, amount concentration and volume of OPA, amount concentration of ammonium chloride, flow rate and reaction coil length - and the gas-diffusion process - sample and HCl volumes, length of mixing coil, donor flow rate - were studied. The proposed method was validated in terms of linearity (1-40 mgL(-1), r=0.9997), limit of detection (c(L)=0.3 mgL(-1)) and quantitation (c(Q)=1.0 mgL(-1)), precision (s(r)=2.2% at 20 mgL(-1) sulfite, n=12) and selectivity. The applicability of the analytical procedure was evaluated by analyzing white and red wine samples, while the accuracy as expressed by recovery experiments ranged between 96% and 106%."

The D1/D2 phylogeny showed that 'O. pini' ATCC 28781 and 'P. pini' NBRC 1794 belonged to the Ogataea cluster, whereas a comparison of the ITS 1 and 2 regions sequences showed that the ATCC and NBRC strains each formed a species distinct from O. ganodermae, O. pini, O. henricii, and P. zsoltii, based on the D1/D2 sequence divergence. The ATCC and NBRC strains formed two to four hat-shaped ascospores and two to four, or more ones per deliquescent ascus, respectively, were negative for DBB and urease reactions, assimilated methanol slowly and nitrate not at all, and had the major ubiquinone system Q-7. These characteristics coincided basically with the definition of Ogataea proposed by Yamada et al. in 1994, excluding the number of ascospores. On the other hand, the ATCC and NBRC strains differed not only from each other but from relatives in various phenotypic characteristics. These differences suggest that two new yeasts of Ogataea be described as novel. The new species and their type strains are as follows: O. neopini ATCC 28781(T); and O. corticis NBRC 1794(T). In addition, the emendation of the genus Ogataea is made; besides, we propose the transfer of P. zsoltii, P. dorogensis, and P. trehaloabstinens, which were placed in the Ogataea cluster based on the D1/D2 sequence analysis, to the genus Ogataea as O. zsoltii comb. nov., O. dorogensis comb. nov., and O. trehaloabstinens comb. nov."

Sequence analysis detected two alternate forms of the gene with a nucleotide difference at position 331 (A or G) in the coding sequence (NSP4-A or NSP4-G) leading to a change from neutral glutamine97 in NSP4-A to a positively charged arginine97 in NSP4-G originating from the same ATCC-Wa preparation. In addition to this, both forms of ATCC-Wa NSP4 revealed three mutations at nucleotide positions 88 (T to C), 142 (C to T) and 572 (G to A), when compared to the previously reported NSP4 sequence from virulent Wa strain. The former two mutations were in the coding sequence and resulted in a leucine16 to serine16 and a proline34 to leucine34 change, while the third mutation was in the 3' non-coding region of the gene. The two amino acid changes may contribute to the 'tissue culture-adaptation' of ATCC-Wa strain. The ATCC-Wa NSP4 sequence was found to differ from the previously reported NSP4 sequence of attenuated Wa strain by lacking a mutation at 133 (T to C), though the mutations at 88 and 142 were present in both strains. Furthermore, comparison of deduced amino acid sequence of NSP4 from human, bovine, porcine and simian rotavirus strains identified a seven-residue (positions 135-141) inter-species variable domain in its C-terminal region."

The decrease in the enzyme activity at incubation temperatures over 40 degrees C was consistent with the decrease in the amount of bound PLP. Unfolding of the enzyme at temperatures above 40 degrees C was suppressed in the presence of PLP. In the presence of 0.125 mM PLP, the specific activity of the psychrophilic enzyme was higher than that of a thermophilic alanine racemase, having a high catalytic activity at high temperature, from Bacillus stearothermophilus even at 60 degrees C."

An analysis of liver samples from 59 PH1 patients showed considerable heterogeneity at the enzymic level. Approximately two thirds of patients had zero AGT catalytic activity, whereas the remaining one third had activities that ranged from 3% to 48% of the mean normal level. Two thirds of patients with zero AGT activity also had zero immunoreactive AGT protein, while the other one third, together with all the patients with detectable AGT catalytic activity, had levels of immunoreactive AGT protein that varied from normal to only a few percent of normal. All patients with AGT catalytic activity had their enzyme in the wrong intracellular compartment (ie, mitochondria). On the other hand, in all but one of the patients with immunoreactive AGT protein, but zero catalytic activity, the inactive AGT was correctly located within the peroxisomes. This enzymic heterogeneity was matched by considerable heterogeneity at the clinical level (eg, age at onset, rate of progression, age at renal failure, etc). No simple relationship was found between the level of hepatic AGT and the severity of the disease. It is suggested that a lack of AGT might be responsible for a broader pathological phenotype than classically associated with PH1. The possibility is advanced that some patients with idiopathic oxalate stone disease might owe their predisposition to stone formation to a functional deficiency of AGT."

The effects produced by purified endo-xylanases from two different glycosyl hydrolase families (family 10 and 11) as well as acetyl xylan esterases were examined and assessed on pulp in relation to their bleaching abilities. The purified endo-xylanases hydrolyzed only a limited portion (less than 30%) of the acetylglucuronoxylan present in the pulp. The enzymes of family 10 produced acetylated xylobiose and xylotriose whereas acetylated xylobiose was not observed among the products released from the pulp by the family 11 xylanases. The esterases however were not capable of deacetylating the acetylated aldouronic acids generated by the xylanases. Regardless of the different mode of action of the endo-xylanases on dissolving pulp, their effect on pulp bleaching was not related to the amount and nature of sugars generated or the glycosyl hydrolase family.

Its balanced sugar (cellobiose, lactose, mannitol, and trehalose) and protein (beef extract and polypeptone peptone) formulation provided Salmonella with a selective growth advantage over non-Salmonella enteric organisms. The formulations promoted the production and detection of H2S production levels that otherwise might be missed with traditional agar formulations. In combination, these advantages contributed to increased sensitivity without the loss of specificity. In comparative studies using 86 samples of meat products (beef, pork, and chicken), the new media, Miller-Mallinson (MM) agar and xylose lysine tergitol (Niaproof) 4 agar, possessed significantly higher sensitivity (P < 0.001) and an improved specificity over bismuth sulfite, hektoen enteric, and xylose lysine desoxycholate agars. However, these samples did not contain nontyphoid salmonellae with weak to ultraweak H2S production characteristics. Modified formulations of MM agar were generally similar to bismuth sulfite and hektoen enteric agars in the identification of four of seven globally diverse strains of Salmonella serotype Typhi. Two of these seven strains were found to produce more readily identifiable black (H2S-positive) colonies on MM agar, whereas one of the seven was not readily detected by any of the media. The improved detection of nontyphoid and typhoid salmonellae attests to the sensitivity of MM agar and to its potentially broad utility in both clinical and food quality laboratories."

We studied the structure of dimeric supercomplexes of photosystem II and its associated light-harvesting antenna by electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis. Comparison of averaged projections from native complexes and complexes without extrinsic polypeptides indicates that the removal of 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic subunits induces a shift of about 1.2 nm in the position of the monomeric peripheral antenna protein CP29 toward the central part of the supercomplex. Removal of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein induces an inward shift of the strongly bound trimeric light-harvesting complex II (S-LHCII) of about 0.9 nm, and in addition destabilizes the monomer-monomer interactions in the central core dimer, leading to structural rearrangements of the core monomers. It is concluded that the extrinsic subunits keep the S-LHCII and CP29 subunits in proper positions at some distance from the central part of the photosystem II core dimer to ensure a directed transfer of excitation energy through the monomeric peripheral antenna proteins CP26 and CP29 and/or to maintain sequestered domains of inorganic cofactors required for oxygen evolution."

In such a situation, profile hidden Markov models (pHMM) can be used to obtain reliable multiple-sequence alignments. We therefore constructed the pHMM with the help of a sequence alignment based on a structural superposition of both proteins. To validate the multiple-sequence alignments obtained with the pHMM, the conservation of residues with known functional importance was examined. Having confirmed the correctness of the multiple-sequence alignments, we analyzed the conservation of residues involved in hydrogen bonding and redox potential tuning of the cofactors. Our analysis reveals similarities and dissimilarities between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II at the protein sequence level, hinting at different charge separation and charge transfer mechanisms. The conservation analysis that we perform in this paper can be considered as a model for analyzing the conservation in proteins with a low level of sequence identity."

The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA."

PSI is very tolerant of excess light but extremely sensitive to excess electrons from PSII. It has been assumed that PSI is protected from photoinhibition by strict control of the intersystem electron transfer chain (ETC). Here we demonstrate that the iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters of PSI are more sensitive to high light stress than previously anticipated, but PSI with damaged FeS clusters still functions as a non-photochemical photoprotective energy quencher (PSI-NPQ). Upon photoinhibition of PSI, the highly reduced ETC further triggers thylakoid phosphorylation-based mechanisms that increase energy flow towards PSI. It is concluded that the sensitivity of FeS clusters provides an additional photoprotective mechanism that is able to downregulate PSII, based on PSI quenching and protein phosphorylation."

Balance is achieved through a process of 'state transitions' that increases energy transfer towards PSI when PSII is overexcited (state II), and towards PSII when PSI is overexcited (state I). This is achieved through redox control of the phosphorylation state of light-harvesting antenna complex II (LHCII). PSI is served by both LHCII and four light-harvesting antenna complex I (LHCI) subunits, Lhca1, 2, 3 and 4. Here we demonstrate that despite unchanged levels of LHCII phosphorylation, absence of specific Lhca subunits reduces state transitions in Arabidopsis. The severest phenotype-observed in a mutant lacking Lhca4 (\u0394Lhca4)-displayed a 69% reduction compared with the wild type. Yet, surprisingly, the amounts of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex isolated by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) from digitonin-solubilized thylakoids were similar in the wild type and \u0394Lhca mutants. Fluorescence excitation spectroscopy revealed that in the wild type this PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex is supplemented by energy transfer from additional LHCII trimers in state II, whose binding is sensitive to digitonin, and which are absent in \u0394Lhca4. The grana margins of the thylakoid membrane were found to be the primary site of interaction between this 'extra' LHCII and the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex in state II. The results suggest that the LHCI complexes mediate energetic interactions between LHCII and PSI in the intact membrane. "

Some of these compounds are substrates for the heme-containing enzymes nitric-oxide synthases (NOS) and act as reducing co-substrates for the copper-containing enzyme Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase (DBH) [P. Slama, J.L. Boucher, M. R\u00e9glier, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 316 (2004) 1081-1087]. DBH catalyses the hydroxylation of the important neurotransmitter dopamine into norepinephrine in the presence of both molecular oxygen and a reducing co-substrate. Although many molecules have been used as co-substrates for DBH, their interaction at the active site of DBH and their role in mechanism are not clearly characterized. In the present paper, we have used a water-soluble copper-N(3)S complex that mimics the Cu(B) site of DBH, and aromatic N-hydroxyguanidines as reducers to address this question. N-Aryl-N'-hydroxyguanidines readily reduced copper(II) to Cu(I) and were oxidized into a nitrosoamidine as previously observed in reactions performed with purified DBH. These data describe for the first time the reactivity of N-aryl-N'-hydroxyguanidines with a water-soluble copper(II) complex and help to understand the interaction of co-substrates with copper at the active site of DBH."

The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes.

We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction.

In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics. The mutation of Y43L, however, did not induce a significant change in the crystal structure."

Complexation between folic acid (FA) and a typical PAH, anthracene, was investigated using FTIR and UV spectra. Appearance of a new IR band at 2362cm(-1) demonstrates that NH(2)-CN(1)- moiety on pterin (PT) ring in FA is protonated when anthracene is introduced. The shift of the characteristic IR band of the PT ring and the emergence of two charge transfer bands at 254nm and 246nm in UV difference spectra show the presence of pi-pi complexation between folic acid and anthracene. These experiments confirm that anthracene could combine with the pterin ring of folic acid through pi-pi donor-acceptor interaction (EDA) and induce the protonation process in FA upon strengthening electron accepting ability of PT ring."

Current strength susceptibilities have been obtained by numerically integrating separately the diatropic and paratropic contributions to the current flow passing planes through chosen bonds of the molecules. The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2. The calculated current patterns elucidate why the compounds with formally [4n + 2] \u03c0-electrons have unusual aromatic properties violating the H\u00fcckel \u03c0-electron count rule.

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine their affinity and selectivity are correspondingly important. Herein, we have determined the relative strengths of intramolecular interactions between a series of monosaccharides and an aromatic ring close to the glycosylation site in an N-glycoprotein host. We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars. Galactose seems to make the weakest and allose the strongest sugar-aromatic interactions, with glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in between. The NMR solution structures of several of the monosaccharide-containing N-glycoproteins were solved to further understand the origins of the similarities and differences between the monosaccharide-aromatic interaction energies. Peracetylation of the monosaccharides substantially increases the strength of the sugar-aromatic interaction in the context of our N-glycoprotein host. Finally, we discuss our results in light of recent literature regarding the contribution of electrostatics to CH-\u03c0 interactions and speculate on what our observations imply about the absolute conservation of GlcNAc as the monosaccharide through which N-linked glycans are attached to glycoproteins in eukaryotes.

Three of the inhibitors possessing either no substituents or electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic rings led to high levels of cytotoxicity and antiviral activity. Intrigued by the potential implications of electronic effects on activity, we probed whether the active compounds could be nonspecifically reacting via 1,4-addition. To investigate this hypothesis, the compounds were incubated with glutathione and upon LC/MS analysis, molecular ion peaks corresponding to both mono and double addition adducts were identified. Second, we synthesized analogs lacking the ability to participate in 1,4-addition and tested them for antiviral activity and cytotoxicity, and found the compounds inactive for both activities. Taken together, the studies reported herein suggest that compounds lacking electron-donating substituents on the aromatic ring are promiscuous acceptors of biological nucleophiles, whereas compounds possessing electron-donating substituents seem to resist addition or at least be more selective and significantly less toxic."

All six isolates were capable of growth on at least three of the eight aromatic monomers presented (anthranilate, benzoate, p-hydroxybenzoate, salicylate, vanillate, ferulate, protocatechuate, and coumarate). Four of the Roseobacter group isolates had inducible protocatechuate 3, 4-dioxygenase activity in cell extracts when grown on p-hydroxybenzoate. The pcaGH genes encoding this ring cleavage enzyme were cloned and sequenced from two isolates, Sagittula stellata E-37 and isolate Y3F, and in both cases the genes could be expressed in Escherichia coli to yield dioxygenase activity. Additional genes involved in the protocatechuate branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway (pcaC, pcaQ, and pobA) were found to cluster with pcaGH in these two isolates. Pairwise sequence analysis of the pca genes revealed greater similarity between the two Roseobacter group isolates than between genes from either Roseobacter strain and soil bacteria. A degenerate PCR primer set targeting a conserved region within PcaH successfully amplified a fragment of pcaH from two additional Roseobacter group isolates, and Southern hybridization indicated the presence of pcaH in the remaining two isolates. This evidence of protocatechuate 3, 4-dioxygenase and the beta-ketoadipate pathway was found in all six Roseobacter isolates, suggesting widespread abilities to degrade aromatic compounds in this marine lineage."

Tyrosine 43 is positioned parallel to the fifth heme axial ligand, His34, of heme 1 in the tetraheme cytochrome c(3). The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics. The mutation of Y43L, however, did not induce a significant change in the crystal structure."

The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2.

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine their affinity and selectivity are correspondingly important. Herein, we have determined the relative strengths of intramolecular interactions between a series of monosaccharides and an aromatic ring close to the glycosylation site in an N-glycoprotein host. We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars. Galactose seems to make the weakest and allose the strongest sugar-aromatic interactions, with glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in between. The NMR solution structures of several of the monosaccharide-containing N-glycoproteins were solved to further understand the origins of the similarities and differences between the monosaccharide-aromatic interaction energies. Peracetylation of the monosaccharides substantially increases the strength of the sugar-aromatic interaction in the context of our N-glycoprotein host. Finally, we discuss our results in light of recent literature regarding the contribution of electrostatics to CH-\u03c0 interactions and speculate on what our observations imply about the absolute conservation of GlcNAc as the monosaccharide through which N-linked glycans are attached to glycoproteins in eukaryotes.

This value is similar to that calculated from the change in surface-accessible area between the rings on the formation of the pair. Analysis of a further double-mutant cycle in which the Tyr residues are mutated to Phe indicates that the aromatic-aromatic interactions of Tyr/Tyr and Phe/Phe make identical contributions to protein stability.

FTIR-ATR (attenuated total reflectance) spectroscopy was used to monitor the polyanhydride/anhydride reaction rates in dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, and 1,4-dioxane solutions at room temperature. The reaction kinetics was determined by measuring the anhydride peak loss with time. Aminolysis resulted from nucleophilic attack of the added amine on the carbonyl group of the anhydride moiety. Primary and secondary amines reacted to form amides and the reaction followed second-order kinetics. Second-order rate constants and reaction half-life (t(1/2)) were calculated from the semilog plots of [anhydride]/[amine] in 1,4-dioxane at room temperature. The aminolysis rate decreased with pK(a) of the amine reactant, and half-life (t(1/2)) decreased with increasing amine concentration, as expected. With trifluoroethylamine (pK(a) 5.8), myristic anhydride reacted about 6-fold faster than benzoic anhydride. The lower reaction rate of benzoic anhydride was due to the higher stability of the aromatic anhydride compared to aliphatic. The overall CPPSA1:6 copolymer reactivity was the sum of aliphatic-aliphatic (SA-SA), aliphatic-aromatic (SA-CPP), and aromatic-aromatic (CPP-CPP) anhydride linkage reactivities. Based on the monomer ratio, the probability of SA-SA, SA-CPP, and CPP-CPP dyads were calculated to be 0.74, 0.24, and 0.02, respectively. This indicated that CPPSA1:6 reactivity will mainly result from SA-SA and SA-CPP linkages. The second-order rate constants and t(1/2) obtained for CPPSA1:6 with TFEA were closer to those for myristic anhydride than benzoic anhydride with TFEA."

The pathways along which excitation energy is transferred between them, and their assembly mechanisms, remain to be deciphered through high-resolution structural studies. Here we report the structure of a 1.1-megadalton spinach photosystem II-LHCII supercomplex solved at 3.2\u2009\u00c5 resolution through single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals a homodimeric supramolecular system in which each monomer contains 25 protein subunits, 105 chlorophylls, 28 carotenoids and other cofactors. Three extrinsic subunits (PsbO, PsbP and PsbQ), which are essential for optimal oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem II, form a triangular crown that shields the Mn4CaO5-binding domains of CP43 and D1. One major trimeric and two minor monomeric LHCIIs associate with each core-complex monomer, and the antenna-core interactions are reinforced by three small intrinsic subunits (PsbW, PsbH and PsbZ). By analysing the closely connected interfacial chlorophylls, we have obtained detailed insights into the energy-transfer pathways between the antenna and core complexes."

It consists of a large number of intrinsic membrane proteins involved in light-harvesting and electron-transfer processes and of a number of extrinsic proteins required to stabilize photosynthetic oxygen evolution. We studied the structure of dimeric supercomplexes of photosystem II and its associated light-harvesting antenna by electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis. Comparison of averaged projections from native complexes and complexes without extrinsic polypeptides indicates that the removal of 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic subunits induces a shift of about 1.2 nm in the position of the monomeric peripheral antenna protein CP29 toward the central part of the supercomplex. Removal of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein induces an inward shift of the strongly bound trimeric light-harvesting complex II (S-LHCII) of about 0.9 nm, and in addition destabilizes the monomer-monomer interactions in the central core dimer, leading to structural rearrangements of the core monomers. It is concluded that the extrinsic subunits keep the S-LHCII and CP29 subunits in proper positions at some distance from the central part of the photosystem II core dimer to ensure a directed transfer of excitation energy through the monomeric peripheral antenna proteins CP26 and CP29 and/or to maintain sequestered domains of inorganic cofactors required for oxygen evolution."

The Raman and IR spectra present some marker bands useful to identify the sites involved in metal chelation at a specific pH value. In particular, the neutral imidazole group gives rise to some Raman bands, such as the nu C(4)===C(5) band, that change in wave number, depending on whether the imidazole ring takes the tautomeric form I or II. Even if tautomer I is predominant in the free ligand, metal coordination can upset tautomeric preference and N(tau)- and N(pi)-ligated complexes can be identified. Although weak compared to those of aromatic residues, these Raman marker bands may be useful in analyzing metal-histidine interaction in peptides and proteins. On the basis of the vibrational results, conclusions can be drawn on the species existing in the system. Depending on the available nitrogen atoms, various complexes can be formed and the prevalent form of the species depends mainly on the pH. At basic pH carnosine gives rise to two different neutral complexes: a water-insoluble polymeric species, [ZnH(-1)L](0)(n), and a dimer, [Zn(2)H(-2)L(2)](0). The first is predominant and involves the tautomeric I form of the imidazole ring in metal chelation; the second contains tautomer II and increases its percentage by going from a 2 to 0.25 metal/ligand ratio. Conversely, the dimeric species dominates at pH 7, whereas two charged species, [ZnHL](2+) and [ZnL](+), are formed under slightly acidic conditions. In the [ZnHL](2+) complex the imidazole ring takes part in the Zn(II) coordination in the tautomeric I form, whereas in [ZnL](+) the ring is protonated and not bound to the Zn(II) ion. In addition, the curve fitting analysis of the 1700-1530 cm(-1) Raman region was helpful in indicating the predominant species at each pH."

Tyrosine 43 is positioned parallel to the fifth heme axial ligand, His34, of heme 1 in the tetraheme cytochrome c(3). The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics. The mutation of Y43L, however, did not induce a significant change in the crystal structure."

These proteins share the same fold and perform the same biological function. Nevertheless, the details of their molecular reaction mechanism differ. It is of significant biological and biochemical interest to determine which functional characteristics are conserved at the level of the protein sequences. Since the level of sequence identity between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II is low, a progressive multiple-sequence alignment leads to errors in identifying the conserved residues. In such a situation, profile hidden Markov models (pHMM) can be used to obtain reliable multiple-sequence alignments. We therefore constructed the pHMM with the help of a sequence alignment based on a structural superposition of both proteins. To validate the multiple-sequence alignments obtained with the pHMM, the conservation of residues with known functional importance was examined. Having confirmed the correctness of the multiple-sequence alignments, we analyzed the conservation of residues involved in hydrogen bonding and redox potential tuning of the cofactors. Our analysis reveals similarities and dissimilarities between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II at the protein sequence level, hinting at different charge separation and charge transfer mechanisms. The conservation analysis that we perform in this paper can be considered as a model for analyzing the conservation in proteins with a low level of sequence identity."

Current strength susceptibilities have been obtained by numerically integrating separately the diatropic and paratropic contributions to the current flow passing planes through chosen bonds of the molecules. The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2. The calculated current patterns elucidate why the compounds with formally [4n + 2] \u03c0-electrons have unusual aromatic properties violating the H\u00fcckel \u03c0-electron count rule. The current density calculations also provide valuable information for interpreting the measured (1)H NMR spectra. "

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine their affinity and selectivity are correspondingly important. Herein, we have determined the relative strengths of intramolecular interactions between a series of monosaccharides and an aromatic ring close to the glycosylation site in an N-glycoprotein host. We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars. Galactose seems to make the weakest and allose the strongest sugar-aromatic interactions, with glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in between. The NMR solution structures of several of the monosaccharide-containing N-glycoproteins were solved to further understand the origins of the similarities and differences between the monosaccharide-aromatic interaction energies. Peracetylation of the monosaccharides substantially increases the strength of the sugar-aromatic interaction in the context of our N-glycoprotein host. Finally, we discuss our results in light of recent literature regarding the contribution of electrostatics to CH-\u03c0 interactions and speculate on what our observations imply about the absolute conservation of GlcNAc as the monosaccharide through which N-linked glycans are attached to glycoproteins in eukaryotes.

Second-order kinetics were obtained for reduction of the type I copper with a rate constant of 2.7 X 10(7) M-1 s-1, which is comparable to that obtained with other blue copper proteins such as plastocyanin. Following reduction, the type I copper was reoxidized in a protein concentration independent (i.e., intramolecular) reaction (kobs = 160 s-1). Comparison with literature values for limiting rate constants in transient single-turnover kinetic experiments suggests that intramolecular electron transfer probably is the rate-limiting step in enzyme catalysis. The extent of reoxidation of type I copper was approximately 55%, which is consistent with the approximately equal redox potentials of the type I and type III copper centers. Neither azide nor fluoride caused any significant changes in kinetics, although they are enzyme inhibitors and are thought to bind to the type II copper. In contrast, cyanide caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the extent of intramolecular electron transfer (with no change in rate constant), and decreased the rate constant for reduction of the type I copper by a factor of 2. The apparent dissociation constant for cyanide (0.2-0.4 mM) is similar to that reported for inhibition of enzyme activity. Removal of the type II copper from AO only marginally affected the kinetics of electron transfer to type I copper (k = 3.2 x 10(7) M-1 s-1) and slightly increased the extent but did not alter the rate constant of intramolecular electron transfer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Mean brain weights of AN-treated mice were increased as a function of dose compared to controls, but there was no significant change in the ratio of liver/body weight in the four groups. While mean brain zinc decreased as a function of AN dosage, mean liver zinc of the low-dose group significantly increased (p < 0.05); mean liver copper in the medium-dose AN group was significantly higher compared to controls (p < 0.05); however, mean brain copper was increased, but the difference did not attain statistical significance in the three AN groups when compared with the controls (p > 0.05). Mean brain iron levels were significantly decreased in the middle-dose AN group (p < 0.05), but there were no consistent changes in liver iron. Tissue levels of selenium in brain and liver were similar for the control and AN treatment groups. AN induces significant and differential changes in the levels of zinc, copper, and iron in brain and liver.

It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO.

Correlations between plasma concentrations and intake of nutrients and food groups were calculated using a stepwise linear regression model. The results showed that the determination of copper plasma concentrations are inadequate to predict copper intake from dietary records. A better indicator for copper supply may be the evaluation of those food items, which are the predominant sources of copper intake at the population level. The highest influence on copper plasma concentration was found for the intake of meat, representing not only the most important food group for copper supply but also the most important food group for fat and protein supply.

Native gel shift experiments with the periplasmic N-terminal domain of the YcnJ membrane protein (135 residues) disclosed its strong affinity to Cu(II) ions in vitro. Inspection of the upstream sequence of ycnJ revealed that the ycnK gene encodes a putative transcriptional regulator, whose deletion caused an elevated expression of ycnJ, especially under conditions of copper excess.

The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA."

The stable ceruloplasmin was further mutated to perturb the environment of copper at the type 1 copper sites in two different domains. The wild type and the mutated ceruloplasmin were produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris and characterized. The mutations R481A, R701A, and K887A were at the proteolytic sites, did not alter the enzymatic activity, and were all necessary to protect ceruloplasmin from degradation. The mutation L329M was at the tricoordinate type 1 site of the domain 2 and was ineffective to induce modifications of the spectroscopic and catalytic properties of ceruloplasmin, supporting the hypothesis that this site is reduced and locked in a rigid frame. In contrast the mutation C1021S at the type 1 site of domain 6 substantially altered the molecular properties of the protein, leaving a small fraction endowed with oxidase activity. This result, while indicating the importance of this site in stabilizing the overall protein structure, suggests that another type 1 site is competent for dioxygen reduction. During the expression of ceruloplasmin, the yeast maintained a high level of Fet3 that was released from membranes of yeast not harboring the ceruloplasmin gene. This indicates that expression of ceruloplasmin induces a state of iron deficiency in yeast because the ferric iron produced in the medium by its ferroxidase activity is not available for the uptake."

Second-order kinetics were obtained for reduction of the type I copper with a rate constant of 2.7 X 10(7) M-1 s-1, which is comparable to that obtained with other blue copper proteins such as plastocyanin. Following reduction, the type I copper was reoxidized in a protein concentration independent (i.e., intramolecular) reaction (kobs = 160 s-1). Comparison with literature values for limiting rate constants in transient single-turnover kinetic experiments suggests that intramolecular electron transfer probably is the rate-limiting step in enzyme catalysis. The extent of reoxidation of type I copper was approximately 55%, which is consistent with the approximately equal redox potentials of the type I and type III copper centers. Neither azide nor fluoride caused any significant changes in kinetics, although they are enzyme inhibitors and are thought to bind to the type II copper. In contrast, cyanide caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the extent of intramolecular electron transfer (with no change in rate constant), and decreased the rate constant for reduction of the type I copper by a factor of 2. The apparent dissociation constant for cyanide (0.2-0.4 mM) is similar to that reported for inhibition of enzyme activity. Removal of the type II copper from AO only marginally affected the kinetics of electron transfer to type I copper (k = 3.2 x 10(7) M-1 s-1) and slightly increased the extent but did not alter the rate constant of intramolecular electron transfer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Kinetics of the ceruloplasmin-P16 binding was studied by affinity chromatography on P16 immobilized on a macroporous disk, and the Kd value (1.5 x 10(-6) M) of this interaction was determined. The ATP7A involvement in the copper ion transfer to nonhepatocyte cells is discussed."

The phylogenetic analysis performed in our study also clearly demonstrates that the emergence of the family of seven P2X channels in human and other mammalian species was a relatively recent evolutionary event that occurred subsequent to the split between vertebrates and invertebrates. Furthermore, several characteristics of HdP2X including fast kinetics with low ATP sensitivity, potentiation by ivermectin in a channel with fast kinetics and distinct copper and zinc binding sites not dependent on histidines make HdP2X a useful model for comparative structure-function studies allowing a better understanding of P2X receptors in higher organisms."

However, under nonadequate hemodynamic conditions and because of the changes related to ischemia-reperfusion, there is a possibility to provoke oxidative stress with all undesirable consequences. Copper (Cu) is closely related to this stress, taking part in the formation of the hazardous-free radicals. Meanwhile, at least in the pediatric area, little is known about Cu kinetics during cardiac surgery. The purpose of the present work was to study Cu and ceruloplasmin (Cp) dynamics during surgery with CPB in children. Twenty-one patients of both genders from Campo Grande, Brazil with congenital heart conditions were enrolled in the investigation. Blood samples were collected before the surgery and during and 24 h after it. Cu and Cp levels were measured at selected moments and the influence of hemodilution studied. It was concluded that serum Cu dynamics during cardiopulmonary bypass reflects the protective effects of this trace element. Ceruloplasmin levels correlate positively with copper."

This has some limitations because copper concentration in plasma fluctuates with age, exercise and health status and does not increase after a meal nor decrease during short-term fasting. The Austrian Study on Nutritional Status (ASNS) provides data on nutrient intake and corresponding plasma concentrations, permitting to evaluate the suitability of copper plasma concentration as a marker of copper intake. Copper intake and intake of relevant nutrients and food groups were evaluated from 7-day weighed food records from 2,400 preschool and schoolchildren between 4 and 19 years of age. Blood samples were collected from a subgroup of 1,400 of these children. The copper concentration in plasma was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Correlations between plasma concentrations and intake of nutrients and food groups were calculated using a stepwise linear regression model. The results showed that the determination of copper plasma concentrations are inadequate to predict copper intake from dietary records. A better indicator for copper supply may be the evaluation of those food items, which are the predominant sources of copper intake at the population level. The highest influence on copper plasma concentration was found for the intake of meat, representing not only the most important food group for copper supply but also the most important food group for fat and protein supply. The individual copper status can only be estimated accurately when information on characteristic enzyme activities under control of additional factors of influence or even body stores of copper are available."

Copper-deficient animals had elevated heart weights and reduced body and spleen weights. Plasma cholesterol levels were significantly elevated and hematocrits were reduced. Absolute rates of carcass cholesterol synthesis per organ were 1.9-fold higher in copper-deficient rats (P less than 0.025). Previous studies have indicated that hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (E.C.1.1.1.34) activity is increased by copper deficiency; however, de novo synthesis of cholesterol from 3H-labelled water was not significantly elevated in the liver. The present data indicate that newly synthesized cholesterol exported to the plasma was increased 2.1-fold (P less than 0.01) in copper-deficient rats. Since it has been demonstrated that hepatic export of cholesterol is increased with copper deficiency and that the major tissue for export of newly synthesized cholesterol is the liver, we hypothesize that the origin of radiolabeled cholesterol in the plasma was the liver.

We studied the structure of dimeric supercomplexes of photosystem II and its associated light-harvesting antenna by electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis. Comparison of averaged projections from native complexes and complexes without extrinsic polypeptides indicates that the removal of 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic subunits induces a shift of about 1.2 nm in the position of the monomeric peripheral antenna protein CP29 toward the central part of the supercomplex. Removal of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein induces an inward shift of the strongly bound trimeric light-harvesting complex II (S-LHCII) of about 0.9 nm, and in addition destabilizes the monomer-monomer interactions in the central core dimer, leading to structural rearrangements of the core monomers. It is concluded that the extrinsic subunits keep the S-LHCII and CP29 subunits in proper positions at some distance from the central part of the photosystem II core dimer to ensure a directed transfer of excitation energy through the monomeric peripheral antenna proteins CP26 and CP29 and/or to maintain sequestered domains of inorganic cofactors required for oxygen evolution."

These proteins share the same fold and perform the same biological function. Nevertheless, the details of their molecular reaction mechanism differ. It is of significant biological and biochemical interest to determine which functional characteristics are conserved at the level of the protein sequences. Since the level of sequence identity between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II is low, a progressive multiple-sequence alignment leads to errors in identifying the conserved residues. In such a situation, profile hidden Markov models (pHMM) can be used to obtain reliable multiple-sequence alignments. We therefore constructed the pHMM with the help of a sequence alignment based on a structural superposition of both proteins. To validate the multiple-sequence alignments obtained with the pHMM, the conservation of residues with known functional importance was examined. Having confirmed the correctness of the multiple-sequence alignments, we analyzed the conservation of residues involved in hydrogen bonding and redox potential tuning of the cofactors. Our analysis reveals similarities and dissimilarities between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II at the protein sequence level, hinting at different charge separation and charge transfer mechanisms. The conservation analysis that we perform in this paper can be considered as a model for analyzing the conservation in proteins with a low level of sequence identity."

Inspection of the upstream sequence of ycnJ revealed that the ycnK gene encodes a putative transcriptional regulator, whose deletion caused an elevated expression of ycnJ, especially under conditions of copper excess. Further studies demonstrated that the recently identified copper efflux regulator CsoR also is involved in the regulation of ycnJ expression, leading to a new model for copper homeostasis in B. subtilis."

Phosphoramidites for automated GNA solid phase synthesis were synthesized economically in a few steps starting from commercially available enantiopure glycidol. Similar to their behavior in DNA, the hydroxypyridone and pyridopurine homo-base pairs display a metal-dependent base pairing, with the hydroxypyridone base pair exhibiting a preference for copper(II) ions and the pyridopurine a preference for nickel(II) ions. However, these metallo-base pairs show modulated properties in GNA with respect to metal-dependent pairing stabilities and metal selectivities. Most interestingly, the hydroxypyridone homo-base pair and hydroxypyridone-pyridopurine hetero-base pair are particularly well accommodated in the GNA duplex and form copper(II)-dependent base pairs that are more stable compared to a Watson-Crick A:T base pair at the same position by nearly 20 degrees C and 24 degrees C, respectively. The structure of the copper(II)-hydroxypyridone homo-base pair is discussed based on a recent metallo-GNA duplex crystal structure."

The ATCC and NBRC strains formed two to four hat-shaped ascospores and two to four, or more ones per deliquescent ascus, respectively, were negative for DBB and urease reactions, assimilated methanol slowly and nitrate not at all, and had the major ubiquinone system Q-7.

In this method, (i) an insoluble natural melanin (from Sepia melanin) and a synthetic model melanin (having a cysteinyldopamine-melanin core and dopamine-melanin shell) were entrapped in a nonconducting hydrogel film adjacent to an electrode, (ii) the film-coated electrode was immersed in solutions containing PQ (putative redox cycling reductant) and a redox cycling oxidant (ferrocene dimethanol), (iii) sequences of input potentials (i.e., voltages) were imposed to the underlying electrode to systematically engage reductive and oxidative redox cycling, and (iv) output response currents were analyzed for signatures of redox cycling. The response characteristics of the PQ-melanin systems to various input potential sequences support the hypothesis that PQ can directly donate electrons to melanin. This observation of PQ-melanin redox interactions demonstrates an association between two components that have been individually linked to oxidative stress and Parkinson's disease.

The resulting chloramphenicol-resistant mutant D. vulgaris H801 grows normally when lactate or pyruvate serve as electron donors for sulfate reduction. Growth with hydrogen as electron donor for sulfate reduction (acetate and CO2 as the carbon source) is impaired. These results confirm the importance of the Hmc complex in electron transport from hydrogen to sulfate. Mutant H801 is also deficient in low-redox-potential niche establishment. On plates, colony development takes 14 days longer than colony development of the wild-type strain, when the cells use hydrogen as the electron donor.

We have conducted structural studies on the redox regulation of PTP1B and have demonstrated that the oxidation of the catalytic cysteine results in the formation of a bond between the sulfur atom of the catalytic cysteine and the amide nitrogen of the neighboring serine. This bond, referred to here as a sulfenamide bond, is reversible upon the addition of glutathione, indicating that this sulfenamide intermediate could function within signaling pathways to protect the cysteine from overoxidation to less readily reducible states. Formation of the sulfenamide bond is accompanied by changes in the tertiary structure at the catalytic site, and these changes may be important for additional regulation of the enzyme.

More recently, redox-dependent inactivation has emerged as a critical factor in attenuating PTP activity in response to cellular stimuli. The tandem Src homology 2 domain-containing PTPs (SHPs) belong to the family of nonreceptor PTPs whose activity can be modulated by reversible oxidation in vivo. Herein we have investigated in vitro the kinetic and mechanistic details of reversible oxidation of SHP-1 and SHP-2. We have confirmed the susceptibility of the active site cysteines of SHPs to oxidative inactivation, with rate constants for oxidation similar to other PTPs (2-10 M(-1) s(-1)). Both SHP-1 and SHP-2 can be reduced and reactivated with the reductants DTT and gluthathione, whereas only the catalytic domain of SHP-2 is subject to reactivation by thioredoxin. Stabilization of the reversible oxidation state of the SHPs proceeds via a novel mechanism unlike for other PTPs wherein oxidation yields either a disulfide between the catalytic cysteine and a nearby \"backdoor\" cysteine or a sulfenylamide bond with the amide backbone nitrogen of the adjacent amino acid. Instead, in the reversibly oxidized and inactivated SHPs, the catalytic cysteine is rereduced while two conserved backdoor cysteines form an intramolecular disulfide. Formation of this backdoor-backdoor disulfide is dependent on the presence of the active site cysteine and can proceed via either active site cysteine-backdoor cysteine intermediate. Removal of both backdoor cysteines leads to irreversible oxidative inactivation, demonstrating that these two cysteines are necessary and sufficient for ensuring reversible oxidation of the SHPs. Our results extend the mechanisms by which redox regulation of PTPs is used to modulate intracellular signaling pathways."

ICAT labeling of human PDI indicates a difference between the redox state of the two active sites. Furthermore, under auto-oxidation conditions an approximately 80% decrease in available thiols within the a domain was detected.

Recently, we described a novel function for the zinc-finger motif in regulation of RPA's ssDNA binding activity through reduction-oxidation (redox). In this study, we carried out a detailed analysis of wild-type RPA and zinc-finger mutants in redox regulation of their ssDNA binding activity. Any mutation at a zinc-finger cysteine abolished its redox role in regulation of RPA-ssDNA interaction, suggesting that all four zinc-finger cysteines are required for redox regulation. Reactivity of cysteine residues to 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) indicated that wild-type RPA contained 8.2 reactive thiols/molecule including all four cysteines in the zinc-finger motif. Zinc-finger cysteines slowly reacted to DTNB as compared to others.

The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA."

Structural aspects of the nickel sites are examined by a combination of EPR and X-ray absorption spectroscopies, and by single-crystal X-ray diffraction at approximately 1.9 A resolution in the case of Y9F- and D3A-NiSODs. The functional effects of the mutations are examined by kinetic studies employing pulse radiolytic generation of O2- and by redox titrations. These studies reveal that although the structure of the nickel center in NiSOD is unique, the ligand environment is designed to optimize the redox potential at 290 mV and results in the oxidation of 50% of the nickel centers in the oxidized hexamer. Kinetic investigations show that all of the mutant proteins have considerable activity. In the case of Y9F-NiSOD, the enzyme exhibits saturation behavior that is not observed in wild-type (WT) NiSOD and suggests that release of peroxide is inhibited. The crystal structure of Y9F-NiSOD reveals an anion binding site that is occupied by either Cl- or Br- and is located close to but not within bonding distance of the nickel center. The structure of D3A-NiSOD reveals that in addition to affecting the interaction between subunits, this mutation repositions Tyr9 and leads to altered chemistry with peroxide. Comparisons with Mn(SOD) and Fe(SOD) reveal that although different strategies for adjusting the redox potential and supply of protons are employed, NiSOD has evolved a similar strategy for controlling the access of anions to the active site."

Following reduction, the type I copper was reoxidized in a protein concentration independent (i.e., intramolecular) reaction (kobs = 160 s-1). Comparison with literature values for limiting rate constants in transient single-turnover kinetic experiments suggests that intramolecular electron transfer probably is the rate-limiting step in enzyme catalysis. The extent of reoxidation of type I copper was approximately 55%, which is consistent with the approximately equal redox potentials of the type I and type III copper centers. Neither azide nor fluoride caused any significant changes in kinetics, although they are enzyme inhibitors and are thought to bind to the type II copper. In contrast, cyanide caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the extent of intramolecular electron transfer (with no change in rate constant), and decreased the rate constant for reduction of the type I copper by a factor of 2. The apparent dissociation constant for cyanide (0.2-0.4 mM) is similar to that reported for inhibition of enzyme activity. Removal of the type II copper from AO only marginally affected the kinetics of electron transfer to type I copper (k = 3.2 x 10(7) M-1 s-1) and slightly increased the extent but did not alter the rate constant of intramolecular electron transfer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Here, we used a novel electrochemistry-based reverse engineering methodology to test the hypothesis that PQ can undergo reductive redox cycling with melanin. In this method, (i) an insoluble natural melanin (from Sepia melanin) and a synthetic model melanin (having a cysteinyldopamine-melanin core and dopamine-melanin shell) were entrapped in a nonconducting hydrogel film adjacent to an electrode, (ii) the film-coated electrode was immersed in solutions containing PQ (putative redox cycling reductant) and a redox cycling oxidant (ferrocene dimethanol), (iii) sequences of input potentials (i.e., voltages) were imposed to the underlying electrode to systematically engage reductive and oxidative redox cycling, and (iv) output response currents were analyzed for signatures of redox cycling. The response characteristics of the PQ-melanin systems to various input potential sequences support the hypothesis that PQ can directly donate electrons to melanin. This observation of PQ-melanin redox interactions demonstrates an association between two components that have been individually linked to oxidative stress and Parkinson's disease. Potentially, melanin's redox activity could be an important component in understanding the etiology of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. "

In this study, we demonstrate that stimulation with Fas ligand (FasL) induces S-glutathionylation of Fas at cysteine 294 independently of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced oxidase-induced ROS. Instead, Fas is S-glutathionylated after caspase-dependent degradation of Grx1, increasing subsequent caspase activation and apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of Grx1 attenuates S-glutathionylation of Fas and partially protects against FasL-induced apoptosis. Redox-mediated Fas modification promotes its aggregation and recruitment into lipid rafts and enhances binding of FasL. As a result, death-inducing signaling complex formation is also increased, and subsequent activation of caspase-8 and -3 is augmented.

The chemical shift assignments for the 1H and 15N NMR spectra were obtained by a combination of 1H-1H and 1H-15N two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy.

To understand the decrease in stability of the oxidized state of this cytochrome c2 compared to the reduced form, the structural difference between the two redox states were analyzed by the differences in the NOE intensities, pseudo-contact shifts and the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates of the amide protons. We find that the major difference between redox states, although subtle, involve heme protein interactions, orientation of the heme ligands, differences in hydrogen bond networks and, possible alterations in the position of some internal water molecules.

Since the level of sequence identity between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II is low, a progressive multiple-sequence alignment leads to errors in identifying the conserved residues.

Here we demonstrate that despite unchanged levels of LHCII phosphorylation, absence of specific Lhca subunits reduces state transitions in Arabidopsis. The severest phenotype-observed in a mutant lacking Lhca4 (\u0394Lhca4)-displayed a 69% reduction compared with the wild type. Yet, surprisingly, the amounts of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex isolated by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) from digitonin-solubilized thylakoids were similar in the wild type and \u0394Lhca mutants. Fluorescence excitation spectroscopy revealed that in the wild type this PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex is supplemented by energy transfer from additional LHCII trimers in state II, whose binding is sensitive to digitonin, and which are absent in \u0394Lhca4. The grana margins of the thylakoid membrane were found to be the primary site of interaction between this 'extra' LHCII and the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex in state II. The results suggest that the LHCI complexes mediate energetic interactions between LHCII and PSI in the intact membrane. "

The pathways along which excitation energy is transferred between them, and their assembly mechanisms, remain to be deciphered through high-resolution structural studies. Here we report the structure of a 1.1-megadalton spinach photosystem II-LHCII supercomplex solved at 3.2\u2009\u00c5 resolution through single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals a homodimeric supramolecular system in which each monomer contains 25 protein subunits, 105 chlorophylls, 28 carotenoids and other cofactors. Three extrinsic subunits (PsbO, PsbP and PsbQ), which are essential for optimal oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem II, form a triangular crown that shields the Mn4CaO5-binding domains of CP43 and D1. One major trimeric and two minor monomeric LHCIIs associate with each core-complex monomer, and the antenna-core interactions are reinforced by three small intrinsic subunits (PsbW, PsbH and PsbZ). By analysing the closely connected interfacial chlorophylls, we have obtained detailed insights into the energy-transfer pathways between the antenna and core complexes."

It consists of a large number of intrinsic membrane proteins involved in light-harvesting and electron-transfer processes and of a number of extrinsic proteins required to stabilize photosynthetic oxygen evolution. We studied the structure of dimeric supercomplexes of photosystem II and its associated light-harvesting antenna by electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis. Comparison of averaged projections from native complexes and complexes without extrinsic polypeptides indicates that the removal of 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic subunits induces a shift of about 1.2 nm in the position of the monomeric peripheral antenna protein CP29 toward the central part of the supercomplex. Removal of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein induces an inward shift of the strongly bound trimeric light-harvesting complex II (S-LHCII) of about 0.9 nm, and in addition destabilizes the monomer-monomer interactions in the central core dimer, leading to structural rearrangements of the core monomers. It is concluded that the extrinsic subunits keep the S-LHCII and CP29 subunits in proper positions at some distance from the central part of the photosystem II core dimer to ensure a directed transfer of excitation energy through the monomeric peripheral antenna proteins CP26 and CP29 and/or to maintain sequestered domains of inorganic cofactors required for oxygen evolution."

The temperature dependences of these spectral changes have the potential to distinguish between changes caused by the excitonic interaction and temperature-dependent processes. We observed a conformational change in the PSII RC protein part and changes in the spatial positions of the PSII RC pigments of the active D1 branch upon reduction of Pheo-D1 only in the case of high temperature (298 K) dynamics. The resulting absorption difference spectra of PSII RC models equilibrated at temperatures of 77 K and 298 K were highly consistent with our previous experiments in which light-induced bleaching of the PSII RC absorbance spectrum was observable only at 298 K. These results support our previous hypothesis that Pheo-D1 does not interact excitonically with the other chlorins of the PSII RC, since the reduced form of Pheo-D1 causes absorption spectra bleaching only due to temperature-dependent processes."

PSI is very tolerant of excess light but extremely sensitive to excess electrons from PSII. It has been assumed that PSI is protected from photoinhibition by strict control of the intersystem electron transfer chain (ETC). Here we demonstrate that the iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters of PSI are more sensitive to high light stress than previously anticipated, but PSI with damaged FeS clusters still functions as a non-photochemical photoprotective energy quencher (PSI-NPQ). Upon photoinhibition of PSI, the highly reduced ETC further triggers thylakoid phosphorylation-based mechanisms that increase energy flow towards PSI. It is concluded that the sensitivity of FeS clusters provides an additional photoprotective mechanism that is able to downregulate PSII, based on PSI quenching and protein phosphorylation."

Unlike other zinc-finger proteins, RPA zinc-finger motif is not a DNA-binding component, and deletion of the zinc-finger had very little effect on its ssDNA binding activity. Recently, we described a novel function for the zinc-finger motif in regulation of RPA's ssDNA binding activity through reduction-oxidation (redox). In this study, we carried out a detailed analysis of wild-type RPA and zinc-finger mutants in redox regulation of their ssDNA binding activity. Any mutation at a zinc-finger cysteine abolished its redox role in regulation of RPA-ssDNA interaction, suggesting that all four zinc-finger cysteines are required for redox regulation. Reactivity of cysteine residues to 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) indicated that wild-type RPA contained 8.2 reactive thiols/molecule including all four cysteines in the zinc-finger motif. Zinc-finger cysteines slowly reacted to DTNB as compared to others. Zn(II) was not only essential but also uniquely qualified for redox regulation of RPA-ssDNA interaction, suggesting that Zn(II)-cysteine coordination is crucial for the zinc-finger function. Redox status significantly affected initial interaction of RPA with ssDNA but had no effect after RPA formed a stable complex with DNA. Together, our results suggest that the zinc-finger motif mediates the transition of RPA-ssDNA interaction to a stable RPA-ssDNA complex in a redox-dependent manner."

The structure reveals a homodimeric supramolecular system in which each monomer contains 25 protein subunits, 105 chlorophylls, 28 carotenoids and other cofactors. Three extrinsic subunits (PsbO, PsbP and PsbQ), which are essential for optimal oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem II, form a triangular crown that shields the Mn4CaO5-binding domains of CP43 and D1. One major trimeric and two minor monomeric LHCIIs associate with each core-complex monomer, and the antenna-core interactions are reinforced by three small intrinsic subunits (PsbW, PsbH and PsbZ). By analysing the closely connected interfacial chlorophylls, we have obtained detailed insights into the energy-transfer pathways between the antenna and core complexes."

It consists of a large number of intrinsic membrane proteins involved in light-harvesting and electron-transfer processes and of a number of extrinsic proteins required to stabilize photosynthetic oxygen evolution. We studied the structure of dimeric supercomplexes of photosystem II and its associated light-harvesting antenna by electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis. Comparison of averaged projections from native complexes and complexes without extrinsic polypeptides indicates that the removal of 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic subunits induces a shift of about 1.2 nm in the position of the monomeric peripheral antenna protein CP29 toward the central part of the supercomplex. Removal of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein induces an inward shift of the strongly bound trimeric light-harvesting complex II (S-LHCII) of about 0.9 nm, and in addition destabilizes the monomer-monomer interactions in the central core dimer, leading to structural rearrangements of the core monomers. It is concluded that the extrinsic subunits keep the S-LHCII and CP29 subunits in proper positions at some distance from the central part of the photosystem II core dimer to ensure a directed transfer of excitation energy through the monomeric peripheral antenna proteins CP26 and CP29 and/or to maintain sequestered domains of inorganic cofactors required for oxygen evolution."

These proteins share the same fold and perform the same biological function. Nevertheless, the details of their molecular reaction mechanism differ. It is of significant biological and biochemical interest to determine which functional characteristics are conserved at the level of the protein sequences. Since the level of sequence identity between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II is low, a progressive multiple-sequence alignment leads to errors in identifying the conserved residues. In such a situation, profile hidden Markov models (pHMM) can be used to obtain reliable multiple-sequence alignments. We therefore constructed the pHMM with the help of a sequence alignment based on a structural superposition of both proteins. To validate the multiple-sequence alignments obtained with the pHMM, the conservation of residues with known functional importance was examined. Having confirmed the correctness of the multiple-sequence alignments, we analyzed the conservation of residues involved in hydrogen bonding and redox potential tuning of the cofactors. Our analysis reveals similarities and dissimilarities between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II at the protein sequence level, hinting at different charge separation and charge transfer mechanisms. The conservation analysis that we perform in this paper can be considered as a model for analyzing the conservation in proteins with a low level of sequence identity."

PSI is very tolerant of excess light but extremely sensitive to excess electrons from PSII. It has been assumed that PSI is protected from photoinhibition by strict control of the intersystem electron transfer chain (ETC). Here we demonstrate that the iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters of PSI are more sensitive to high light stress than previously anticipated, but PSI with damaged FeS clusters still functions as a non-photochemical photoprotective energy quencher (PSI-NPQ). Upon photoinhibition of PSI, the highly reduced ETC further triggers thylakoid phosphorylation-based mechanisms that increase energy flow towards PSI. It is concluded that the sensitivity of FeS clusters provides an additional photoprotective mechanism that is able to downregulate PSII, based on PSI quenching and protein phosphorylation."

Balance is achieved through a process of 'state transitions' that increases energy transfer towards PSI when PSII is overexcited (state II), and towards PSII when PSI is overexcited (state I). This is achieved through redox control of the phosphorylation state of light-harvesting antenna complex II (LHCII). PSI is served by both LHCII and four light-harvesting antenna complex I (LHCI) subunits, Lhca1, 2, 3 and 4. Here we demonstrate that despite unchanged levels of LHCII phosphorylation, absence of specific Lhca subunits reduces state transitions in Arabidopsis. The severest phenotype-observed in a mutant lacking Lhca4 (\u0394Lhca4)-displayed a 69% reduction compared with the wild type. Yet, surprisingly, the amounts of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex isolated by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) from digitonin-solubilized thylakoids were similar in the wild type and \u0394Lhca mutants. Fluorescence excitation spectroscopy revealed that in the wild type this PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex is supplemented by energy transfer from additional LHCII trimers in state II, whose binding is sensitive to digitonin, and which are absent in \u0394Lhca4. The grana margins of the thylakoid membrane were found to be the primary site of interaction between this 'extra' LHCII and the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex in state II. The results suggest that the LHCI complexes mediate energetic interactions between LHCII and PSI in the intact membrane. "

The reconstituted Lhca1/4, but not complexes obtained with either Lhca1 or Lhca4 alone, closely resembles the native LHCI-730 dimer from tomato leaves with regard to spectroscopic properties, pigment composition, and stoichiometry. Monomeric complexes of Lhca1 or Lhca4 possess lower pigment/protein ratios, indicating that interactions of the two subunits not only facilitates pigment reorganization but also recruitment of additional pigments.

An analysis of liver samples from 59 PH1 patients showed considerable heterogeneity at the enzymic level. Approximately two thirds of patients had zero AGT catalytic activity, whereas the remaining one third had activities that ranged from 3% to 48% of the mean normal level. Two thirds of patients with zero AGT activity also had zero immunoreactive AGT protein, while the other one third, together with all the patients with detectable AGT catalytic activity, had levels of immunoreactive AGT protein that varied from normal to only a few percent of normal. All patients with AGT catalytic activity had their enzyme in the wrong intracellular compartment (ie, mitochondria). On the other hand, in all but one of the patients with immunoreactive AGT protein, but zero catalytic activity, the inactive AGT was correctly located within the peroxisomes. This enzymic heterogeneity was matched by considerable heterogeneity at the clinical level (eg, age at onset, rate of progression, age at renal failure, etc). No simple relationship was found between the level of hepatic AGT and the severity of the disease. It is suggested that a lack of AGT might be responsible for a broader pathological phenotype than classically associated with PH1. The possibility is advanced that some patients with idiopathic oxalate stone disease might owe their predisposition to stone formation to a functional deficiency of AGT."

Efficient cleavage of vif RNA by the synthetic ribozyme occurred at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C in the presence of magnesium ions in vitro. No measurable activity was observed with a vif antisense RNA. A deletion in the hybridizing region of the ribozyme decreased the cleavage rate, while a mutation in the consensus cleavage domain abolished its catalytic activity.

In addition to this plethora of functions, antibodies are capable of expressing enzymatic activity. Antibodies with catalytic function are a result of the productive interplay between the highly evolved machinery of the immune system and the chemical framework used to induce them (antigens). Catalytic antibodies are immunoglobulins with an ability to catalyze the reactions involving the antigen for which they are specific. Catalytic immunoglobulins of the IgM and IgG isotypes have been detected in the serum of healthy donors. In addition, catalytic immunoglobulins of the IgA isotype have been detected in the milk of healthy mothers. Conversely, antigen-specific hydrolytic antibodies have been reported in a number of inflammatory, autoimmune, and neoplastic disorders. The pathophysiological occurrence and relevance of catalytic antibodies remains a debated issue. Through the description of the hydrolysis of coagulation factor VIII as model target antigen, we propose that catalytic antibodies directed to the coagulation factor VIII may play a beneficial or a deleterious role depending on the immuno-inflammatory condition under which they occur."

Kinetics have been characterised at temperatures reaching 740 K and pressures up to 2 atm, with expected maximum operational conditions of up to \u223c900 K and \u223c5 atm.

It is concluded that the extrinsic subunits keep the S-LHCII and CP29 subunits in proper positions at some distance from the central part of the photosystem II core dimer to ensure a directed transfer of excitation energy through the monomeric peripheral antenna proteins CP26 and CP29 and/or to maintain sequestered domains of inorganic cofactors required for oxygen evolution."

The trichlorosilane coupling agent, containing the alkyl halide ATRP initiator, was first immobilized on the hydroxylated SS (SS-OH) substrates for surface-initiated ATRP of (2-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). The tertiary amino groups of covalently immobilized DMAEMA polymer or P(DMAEMA), brushes on the SS substrates were quaternized with benzyl halide to produce the biocidal functionality. Alternatively, covalent coupling of viologen moieties to the tertiary amino groups of P(DMAEMA) brushes on the SS surface resulted in an increase in surface concentration of quaternary ammonium groups, accompanied by substantially enhanced antibacterial and anticorrosion capabilities against Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in anaerobic seawater, as revealed by antibacterial assay and electrochemical studies. With the inherent advantages of high corrosion resistance of SS, and the good antibacterial and anticorrosion capabilities of the viologen-quaternized P(DMAEMA) brushes, the functionalized SS is potentially useful in harsh seawater environments and for desalination plants."

These proteins share the same fold and perform the same biological function. Nevertheless, the details of their molecular reaction mechanism differ. It is of significant biological and biochemical interest to determine which functional characteristics are conserved at the level of the protein sequences. Since the level of sequence identity between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II is low, a progressive multiple-sequence alignment leads to errors in identifying the conserved residues. In such a situation, profile hidden Markov models (pHMM) can be used to obtain reliable multiple-sequence alignments. We therefore constructed the pHMM with the help of a sequence alignment based on a structural superposition of both proteins. To validate the multiple-sequence alignments obtained with the pHMM, the conservation of residues with known functional importance was examined. Having confirmed the correctness of the multiple-sequence alignments, we analyzed the conservation of residues involved in hydrogen bonding and redox potential tuning of the cofactors. Our analysis reveals similarities and dissimilarities between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II at the protein sequence level, hinting at different charge separation and charge transfer mechanisms. The conservation analysis that we perform in this paper can be considered as a model for analyzing the conservation in proteins with a low level of sequence identity."

PSI is very tolerant of excess light but extremely sensitive to excess electrons from PSII. It has been assumed that PSI is protected from photoinhibition by strict control of the intersystem electron transfer chain (ETC). Here we demonstrate that the iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters of PSI are more sensitive to high light stress than previously anticipated, but PSI with damaged FeS clusters still functions as a non-photochemical photoprotective energy quencher (PSI-NPQ). Upon photoinhibition of PSI, the highly reduced ETC further triggers thylakoid phosphorylation-based mechanisms that increase energy flow towards PSI. It is concluded that the sensitivity of FeS clusters provides an additional photoprotective mechanism that is able to downregulate PSII, based on PSI quenching and protein phosphorylation."

Balance is achieved through a process of 'state transitions' that increases energy transfer towards PSI when PSII is overexcited (state II), and towards PSII when PSI is overexcited (state I). This is achieved through redox control of the phosphorylation state of light-harvesting antenna complex II (LHCII). PSI is served by both LHCII and four light-harvesting antenna complex I (LHCI) subunits, Lhca1, 2, 3 and 4. Here we demonstrate that despite unchanged levels of LHCII phosphorylation, absence of specific Lhca subunits reduces state transitions in Arabidopsis. The severest phenotype-observed in a mutant lacking Lhca4 (\u0394Lhca4)-displayed a 69% reduction compared with the wild type. Yet, surprisingly, the amounts of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex isolated by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) from digitonin-solubilized thylakoids were similar in the wild type and \u0394Lhca mutants. Fluorescence excitation spectroscopy revealed that in the wild type this PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex is supplemented by energy transfer from additional LHCII trimers in state II, whose binding is sensitive to digitonin, and which are absent in \u0394Lhca4. The grana margins of the thylakoid membrane were found to be the primary site of interaction between this 'extra' LHCII and the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex in state II. The results suggest that the LHCI complexes mediate energetic interactions between LHCII and PSI in the intact membrane. "

To obtain a better understanding of the regulation of local steroid biosynthesis and metabolism in human tissues, we have established a dual steroidogenic activity of the 17betaHSD2 enzyme after transfection of human 17betaHSD2-transfected human embryonic kidney (293) cells. After transient transfection, the metabolism of testosterone, pregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in intact transfected 293 cells was evaluated by TLC-based radiometric assays. 17betaHSD2-transfected cells converted 91% of testosterone (1 micromol/L) into androstenedione in a 2-h incubation period. In addition, pregnenolone (1 micromol/L) was converted to progesterone (18.5%), whereas DHEA (1 micromol/L) was metabolized to androstenedione (8.3% conversion) in a 15-h incubation period. The kinetics of the 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3betaHSD) and 17betaHSD2 activities using cell homogenate protein of stably transfected 293 cells indicated that the catalytic efficiency (apparent catalytic efficiency = maximum velocity/Km) of this 3betaHSD activity is approximately 2000-fold (pregnenolone as substrate) or 3000-fold (DHEA as substrate) weaker than that of 17betaHSD2 activity. It is noteworthy, however, that the apparent catalytic efficiency of the HSD3B2 gene product is only approximately 50-fold higher than that of the 3betaHSD aspect of the 17betaHSD2 gene product. Pregnenolone or DHEA effectively inhibited 17betaHSD2 activity in a noncompetitive fashion. Furthermore, the potent 5alpha-reductase/3betaHSD inhibitor, 17beta-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-4-aza-5alpha-androstane-3-one , inhibited neither 3betaHSD nor 17betaHSD2 activities. We conclude that human 17betaHSD2 enzyme exhibits 3betaHSD activity. Notwithstanding that this 3betaHSD activity is reduced compared to 17betaHSD oxidative activity, it may account for at least some of the reports of 3betaHSD activity found in human peripheral tissues that express notable amounts of the 17betaHSD2 isozyme as well as in individuals with severe classic 3betaHSD deficiency."

Cloning ilvA, the structural gene for threonine deaminase, under control of the trc promoter results in expression of active enzyme upon induction by isopropyl 1-thio-beta-D-galactoside to levels of approximately 20% of the soluble protein in cell extracts. High level expression of threonine deaminase has facilitated the development of a rapid and efficient protocol for the purification of gram quantities of enzyme with a specific activity 3-fold greater than previous preparations. The catalytic activity of threonine deaminase is absolutely dependent on the presence of pyridoxal phosphate, and the tetrameric molecule is isolated containing 1 mol of cofactor/56,000-Da chain. Wild-type threonine deaminase demonstrates a sigmoidal dependence of initial velocity on threonine concentration in the absence of isoleucine, consistent with a substrate-promoted conversion of the enzyme from a low activity to a high activity conformation. The enzymic dehydration of threonine to alpha-ketobutyrate measured by steady-state kinetics, performed at 20 degrees C in 0.05 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, is described by a Hill coefficient, nH, of 2.3 and a K0.5 of 8.0 mM. The negative allosteric effector L-isoleucine strongly inhibits the enzyme, yielding a value for nH of 3.9 and K0.5 of 74 mM whereas enzyme activity is greatly increased by L-valine, which yields nearly hyperbolic kinetics characterized by a value for nH of 1.0 and a K0.5 of 5.7 mM. Thus, these effectors promote dramatic and opposing effects on the transition from the low activity to the high activity conformation of the tetrameric enzyme."

Catalytic parameters, derived by eliminating residual Fas2-resistant activity, reveal that Fas2 reduces k(cat)/K(m) up to 10(6)-fold for cationic substrates and less than 10(3)-fold for neutral substrates. Rate constants for association of reversible inhibitors with the active center of the AChE.Fas2 complex were reduced about 10(4)-fold for both cationic and neutral inhibitors, while dissociation rate constants were reduced 10(2)-to 10(3)-fold, compared with AChE alone. Rates of ligand association with both AChE and AChE.Fas2 complex were dependent on the protonation state of ionizable ligands but were also markedly reduced by protonation of enzyme residue(s) with pK(a) of 6.1-6.2. Linear free energy relationships between the equilibrium constant and the kinetic constants show that Fas2, presumably through an allosteric influence, markedly alters the position of the transition state in the reaction pathway. Since Fas2 complexation introduces an energetic barrier for hydrolysis of substrates that exceeds that found for association of reversible ligands, Fas2 influences catalytic parameters by a more complex mechanism than simple restriction of diffusional entry and exit from the active center. Conformational flexibility appears critical for facilitating ligand passage in the narrow active center gorge for both AChE and the AChE.Fas2 complex."

In order to address how CT domain ligand occupancy is \"sensed\" by other domains, we generated functional, mixed hybrid tetramers using the E218A (inactive BC domain) and T882S (low pyruvate binding, low activity) mutant forms of PC. The apparent Ka\u00a0pyruvate for the pyruvate-stimulated release of Pi catalyzed by the T882S:E218A[1:1] hybrid tetramer was comparable to the wild-type enzyme and nearly 10-fold lower than that for the T882S homotetramer. In addition, the ratio of the rates of oxaloacetate formation to Pi release for the WT:T882S[1:1] and E218A:T882S[1:1] hybrid tetramer-catalyzed reactions was 0.5 and 0.6, respectively, while the T882S homotetramer exhibited a near 1:1 coupling of the two domains, suggesting that the mechanisms coordinating catalytic events is more complicated that we initially assumed. The results presented here are consistent with an intermolecular communication mechanism, where pyruvate binding to the CT domain is \"sensed\" by domains on a different polypeptide chain within the tetramer.

Tyrosine 43 is positioned parallel to the fifth heme axial ligand, His34, of heme 1 in the tetraheme cytochrome c(3). The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics.

In six subjects, vastus lateralis muscle was sampled at rest, at 32 min, and at exhaustion, and in six subjects, glucose kinetics was determined by infusion of [6,6-(2)H]glucose in both trials and ingestion of [6-(3)H]glucose in the CHO trial. Of the 84 g of glucose ingested during exercise in the CHO trial, only 22 g appeared in the peripheral circulation. This resulted in a small (12 g) but significant (P<0.05) increase in glucose uptake without influencing carbohydrate oxidation, muscle glycogen use, or time to exhaustion (CHO: 68.1+/-4.1 min; Con: 69.6+/-5.5 min). Decreases in muscle phosphocreatine content and increases in muscle inosine monophosphate and lactate content during exercise were similar in the two trials. Although endogenous glucose production during exercise was partially suppressed in the CHO trial, it remained significantly above preexercise levels throughout exercise. In conclusion, only 26% of the ingested glucose appeared in the peripheral circulation. Glucose ingestion increased glucose uptake and partially reduced endogenous glucose production but had no effect on carbohydrate oxidation, muscle metabolism, or time to exhaustion during exercise at 83% peak oxygen uptake."

Diltiazem.HCl has an aqueous solubility greater than 590 mg/ml (37 degrees C) and was released from controlled-porosity osmotic pump devices with first-order kinetics. This high solubility was markedly reduced (155 mg/ml; 37 degrees C) in the presence of NaCl (1 M). Based on theory for osmotically actuated drug release, this reduced solubility would be expected to result in a zero-order release profile of greater than 80% of an initial diltiazem.HCl load. Devices were prepared with cores that contained diltiazem.HCl and sufficient NaCl granules coated with a microporous cellulose acetate butyrate 381-20 film to maintain a 1 M NaCl concentration within the drug compartment over a 16-hr period. This resulted in release of approximately 75% of the initial diltiazem.HCl load with zero-order kinetics over a 14- to 16-hr period. The in vivo performance of these devices in beagle dogs was analyzed. The in vivo percentage diltiazem absorbed profiles were superimposable with the in vitro release profile.

Co-expression in Xenopus oocytes of RGS4 reduces the basal GIRK1/GIRK2 current and strongly increases the percentage agonist-evoked K+ conductance. RGS4 reconstitutes the native gating kinetics by accelerating GIRK1/GIRK2 channel deactivation, a phenomenon also seen after activation with other 7 TM receptors (e.g. muscarine type). In the absence of RGS4, the GIRK1/GIRK2 conductance was increased by approx. 50% after hKOR stimulation with the kappa-selective opioid receptor ligand, U69593; however more importantly, at the end of the washout period it was dramatically reduced to about 60% of the basal conductance as measured before receptor stimulation. Furthermore, we found that repeated receptor stimulation causes an increase of the agonist-gated deactivation kinetics, without affecting the maximal and minimal conductance levels of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels during and after agonist application. Unlike in the absence of RGS4, coexpression with RGS4 completely abolished the reduction of basal conductance after agonist washout and the deactivation kinetics remained unaffected upon repeated agonist application. The results presented here clearly indicate that previous stimulation by agonists activating G protein-coupled receptors may have long-lasting, strong consequences on the following responses. Therefore, our study provides evidence for a novel modulation of deactivation kinetics of GIRK1/GIRK2 currents in the absence of RGS4."

The target analyses reveal the importance of protein relaxation steps in the ET chain for the functioning of PSII. We also tested previously published data on cyanobacterial PSII with open RCs using models that involved protein relaxation steps as suggested by our data on closed RCs. The rationale for this reanalysis is that at least one short-lived component could not be described in the previous simpler models. This new analysis supports the involvement of a protein relaxation step for open RCs as well. In this model the rate of ET from reduced pheophytin to the primary quinone Q(A) is determined to be 4.1 ns(-1). The rate of initial charge separation is slowed down substantially from approximately 170 ns(-1) in PSII with open RCs to 56 ns(-1) upon reduction of Q(A). However, the free-energy drop of the first RP is not changed substantially between the two RC redox states. The currently assumed mechanistic model, assuming the same early RP intermediates in both states of RC, is inconsistent with the presented energetics of the RPs. Additionally, a comparison between PSII with closed RCs in isolated cores and in intact cells reveals slightly different relaxation kinetics, with a approximately 3.7 ns component present only in isolated cores."

Interactions of the apoproteins is highly specific, as reconstitution of either of the two constituent proteins in combination with a light-harvesting protein of photosystem II does not result in dimerization. The reconstituted Lhca1/4, but not complexes obtained with either Lhca1 or Lhca4 alone, closely resembles the native LHCI-730 dimer from tomato leaves with regard to spectroscopic properties, pigment composition, and stoichiometry. Monomeric complexes of Lhca1 or Lhca4 possess lower pigment/protein ratios, indicating that interactions of the two subunits not only facilitates pigment reorganization but also recruitment of additional pigments.

The structure reveals a homodimeric supramolecular system in which each monomer contains 25 protein subunits, 105 chlorophylls, 28 carotenoids and other cofactors. Three extrinsic subunits (PsbO, PsbP and PsbQ), which are essential for optimal oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem II, form a triangular crown that shields the Mn4CaO5-binding domains of CP43 and D1. One major trimeric and two minor monomeric LHCIIs associate with each core-complex monomer, and the antenna-core interactions are reinforced by three small intrinsic subunits (PsbW, PsbH and PsbZ). By analysing the closely connected interfacial chlorophylls, we have obtained detailed insights into the energy-transfer pathways between the antenna and core complexes."

PSI is very tolerant of excess light but extremely sensitive to excess electrons from PSII. It has been assumed that PSI is protected from photoinhibition by strict control of the intersystem electron transfer chain (ETC). Here we demonstrate that the iron-sulphur (FeS) clusters of PSI are more sensitive to high light stress than previously anticipated, but PSI with damaged FeS clusters still functions as a non-photochemical photoprotective energy quencher (PSI-NPQ). Upon photoinhibition of PSI, the highly reduced ETC further triggers thylakoid phosphorylation-based mechanisms that increase energy flow towards PSI. It is concluded that the sensitivity of FeS clusters provides an additional photoprotective mechanism that is able to downregulate PSII, based on PSI quenching and protein phosphorylation."

We studied the structure of dimeric supercomplexes of photosystem II and its associated light-harvesting antenna by electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis. Comparison of averaged projections from native complexes and complexes without extrinsic polypeptides indicates that the removal of 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic subunits induces a shift of about 1.2 nm in the position of the monomeric peripheral antenna protein CP29 toward the central part of the supercomplex. Removal of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein induces an inward shift of the strongly bound trimeric light-harvesting complex II (S-LHCII) of about 0.9 nm, and in addition destabilizes the monomer-monomer interactions in the central core dimer, leading to structural rearrangements of the core monomers. It is concluded that the extrinsic subunits keep the S-LHCII and CP29 subunits in proper positions at some distance from the central part of the photosystem II core dimer to ensure a directed transfer of excitation energy through the monomeric peripheral antenna proteins CP26 and CP29 and/or to maintain sequestered domains of inorganic cofactors required for oxygen evolution."

These proteins share the same fold and perform the same biological function. Nevertheless, the details of their molecular reaction mechanism differ. It is of significant biological and biochemical interest to determine which functional characteristics are conserved at the level of the protein sequences. Since the level of sequence identity between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II is low, a progressive multiple-sequence alignment leads to errors in identifying the conserved residues. In such a situation, profile hidden Markov models (pHMM) can be used to obtain reliable multiple-sequence alignments. We therefore constructed the pHMM with the help of a sequence alignment based on a structural superposition of both proteins. To validate the multiple-sequence alignments obtained with the pHMM, the conservation of residues with known functional importance was examined. Having confirmed the correctness of the multiple-sequence alignments, we analyzed the conservation of residues involved in hydrogen bonding and redox potential tuning of the cofactors. Our analysis reveals similarities and dissimilarities between the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center and Photosystem II at the protein sequence level, hinting at different charge separation and charge transfer mechanisms.

Balance is achieved through a process of 'state transitions' that increases energy transfer towards PSI when PSII is overexcited (state II), and towards PSII when PSI is overexcited (state I). This is achieved through redox control of the phosphorylation state of light-harvesting antenna complex II (LHCII). PSI is served by both LHCII and four light-harvesting antenna complex I (LHCI) subunits, Lhca1, 2, 3 and 4. Here we demonstrate that despite unchanged levels of LHCII phosphorylation, absence of specific Lhca subunits reduces state transitions in Arabidopsis. The severest phenotype-observed in a mutant lacking Lhca4 (\u0394Lhca4)-displayed a 69% reduction compared with the wild type. Yet, surprisingly, the amounts of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex isolated by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) from digitonin-solubilized thylakoids were similar in the wild type and \u0394Lhca mutants. Fluorescence excitation spectroscopy revealed that in the wild type this PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex is supplemented by energy transfer from additional LHCII trimers in state II, whose binding is sensitive to digitonin, and which are absent in \u0394Lhca4. The grana margins of the thylakoid membrane were found to be the primary site of interaction between this 'extra' LHCII and the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex in state II. The results suggest that the LHCI complexes mediate energetic interactions between LHCII and PSI in the intact membrane. "

We observed a conformational change in the PSII RC protein part and changes in the spatial positions of the PSII RC pigments of the active D1 branch upon reduction of Pheo-D1 only in the case of high temperature (298 K) dynamics. The resulting absorption difference spectra of PSII RC models equilibrated at temperatures of 77 K and 298 K were highly consistent with our previous experiments in which light-induced bleaching of the PSII RC absorbance spectrum was observable only at 298 K.

We have investigated the conjugation of ALA to a second-generation dxcendrimer for enhancing porphyrin synthesis in vitro and in vivo in a murine tumour model using systemic i.p. administration. In vitro, the dendrimer was more efficient than ALA for porphyrin synthesis at low concentrations in good correlation with higher cellular ALA dendrimer accumulation. In vivo, the porphyrin kinetics from ALA exhibited an early peak between 3 and 4 h in most tissues, whereas the dendrimer induced sustained porphyrin production for over 24 h and basal values were not reached until 48 h after administration. Integrated porphyrin accumulation from the dendrimer and ALA, at equivalent molar ratios, was comparable showing that the majority of ALA residues were liberated from the dendrimer. The porphyrin kinetics appear to be governed by the rate of enzymatic cleavage of ALA from the dendrimer, which is consistent with in vitro results.

This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster.

The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine.

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer.

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster).

Since then, there has been an ongoing debate about whether Hb allostery involves the unliganded tense T state and the liganded relaxed R state or whether it involves the T state and an ensemble of liganded relaxed states. In fact, the former model is inconsistent with many functional observations, as well as the recent discoveries of several relaxed-state Hb structures such as RR2, R3 and R2. One school of thought has suggested the R2 state to be the physiologically relevant relaxed end state, with the R state mediating the T-->R2 transition. X-ray studies have been performed on human carbonmonoxy Hb at a resolution of 2.8 A. The ensuing liganded quaternary structure is different from previously reported liganded Hb structures. The distal beta-heme pocket is the largest when compared with other liganded Hb structures, partly owing to rotation of betaHis63(E7) out of the distal pocket, creating a ligand channel to the solvent. The structure also shows unusually smaller alpha- and beta-clefts. Results from this study taken in conjunction with previous findings suggest that multiple liganded Hb states with different quaternary structures may be involved in ligand uptake, stabilization, transport and release."

Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule."

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta. Spectroscopic data were consistent with this assumption. The present study proves that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta plays a key role in stabilizing the deoxy T structure and consequently in co-operative oxygen binding."

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

We describe the evolution of the allostery concept, from a conformational change in a two-state model (1965, 1966) to dynamic allostery in the ensemble model (1999); from multi-subunit (1965) proteins to all proteins (2004). We highlight the current available methods to study allostery and their applications in studies of conformational mechanisms, disease, and allosteric drug discovery. We outline the challenges and future directions that we foresee. Altogether, this Editorial narrates the history of this fundamental concept in the life sciences, its significance, methodologies to detect and predict it, and its application in a broad range of living systems.

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta. Spectroscopic data were consistent with this assumption. The present study proves that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta plays a key role in stabilizing the deoxy T structure and consequently in co-operative oxygen binding."

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

Since then, there has been an ongoing debate about whether Hb allostery involves the unliganded tense T state and the liganded relaxed R state or whether it involves the T state and an ensemble of liganded relaxed states. In fact, the former model is inconsistent with many functional observations, as well as the recent discoveries of several relaxed-state Hb structures such as RR2, R3 and R2. One school of thought has suggested the R2 state to be the physiologically relevant relaxed end state, with the R state mediating the T-->R2 transition. X-ray studies have been performed on human carbonmonoxy Hb at a resolution of 2.8 A. The ensuing liganded quaternary structure is different from previously reported liganded Hb structures. The distal beta-heme pocket is the largest when compared with other liganded Hb structures, partly owing to rotation of betaHis63(E7) out of the distal pocket, creating a ligand channel to the solvent. The structure also shows unusually smaller alpha- and beta-clefts. Results from this study taken in conjunction with previous findings suggest that multiple liganded Hb states with different quaternary structures may be involved in ligand uptake, stabilization, transport and release."

The rates of various ligands binding to these proteins in the R-state have been reported by Mathews et al. Here, we present the oxygen equilibrium curves of three E11 alpha mutants and the crystal structures of two of these mutants in the deoxy form. Replacing the distal valine residue of alpha-globin with alanine, leucine or isoleucine has no effect on the oxygen affinity of the protein in either quaternary state, in contrast to the equivalent mutations of beta subunits. The crystal structure of the valine E11 alpha----isoleucine mutant shows that the larger E11 residue excludes water from the haem pocket, but causes no significant movement of other amino acid residues.

It was clarified from the UVRR bands at 1605 and 1166 cm(-)(1) characteristic of tyrosinate that the tyrosine (F8) of the abnormal subunit in Hb M Iwate adopts a deprotonated form. UV Raman bands of other Tyr residues indicated that the protein takes the T-quaternary structure even in the met form. Although both hemes of alpha and beta subunits in metHb A take a six-coordinate (6c) high-spin structure, the 406.7-nm excited RR spectrum of metHb M Iwate indicated that the abnormal alpha subunit adopts a 5c high-spin structure. The present results and our previous observation of the nu(Fe)(-)(O(tyrosine)) Raman band [Nagai et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 2418-2422] have proved that F8-tyrosinate is covalently bound to Fe(III) heme in the alpha subunit of Hb M Iwate. As a result, peripheral groups of porphyrin ring, especially the vinyl and the propionate side chains, were so strongly influenced that the RR spectrum in the low-frequency region excited at 406.7 nm is distinctly changed from the normal pattern. When Hb M Iwate was fully reduced, the characteristic UVRR bands of tyrosinate disappeared and the Raman bands of tyrosine at 1620 (Y8a), 1207 (Y7a), and 1177 cm(-)(1) (Y9a) increased in intensity. Coordination of distal His(E7) to the Fe(II) heme in the reduced alpha subunit of Hb M Iwate was proved by the observation of the nu(Fe)(-)(His) RR band in the 441.6-nm excited RR spectrum at the same frequency as that of its isolated alpha chain. The effects of the distal-His coordination on the heme appeared as a distortion of the peripheral groups of heme.

Using intact hepatocytes or homogenates of hepatocytes, compounds were identified that either inhibited 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate hydrolysis via arylsulfatase or impaired its uptake into cells. For example, sodium sulfate inhibited hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by intact hepatocytes (half-maximal inhibition, 0.1 mM) but not by homogenates, suggesting a selective action on organic sulfate uptake at the plasma membrane. In contrast, cholesterol sulfate inhibited hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by homogenates but not by hepatocytes, consistent with the hypothesis that cholesterol sulfate does not readily enter intact cells. Compounds that inhibited hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by both isolated hepatocytes and microsomes include sodium sulfite (half-maximal inhibition, 0.1 mM), pregnenolone sulfate (half-maximal inhibition, 1 microM), and estrone sulfate (half-maximal inhibition, 10 microM). To test whether production of sulfate conjugates could be modified by agents affecting arylsulfatase in intact hepatocytes, we examined the effects of pregnenolone sulfate on the production of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate from 4-methylumbelliferone. Addition of pregnenolone sulfate (100 microM) to intact cells increased rates of 4-methylumbelliferone sulfate production and decreased the fraction of 4-methylumbelliferone converted into the glucuronide. Hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by isolated microsomes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) when cytosol, a source of sulfotransferase was present. Furthermore, addition of low concentrations of PAPS (0.5 microM) to a reconstituted system of microsomes and cytosol impaired the formation of fluorescent product from 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate until PAPS was consumed, indicating that futile cycling via arylsulfatase and sulfotransferase occurred. Subsequent futile cycling of free 4-methylumbelliferone and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate occurred upon repeated additions of PAPS and was prevented by sodium sulfite, an inhibitor of arylsulfatase. These results argue strongly that sulfate conjugate production within hepatocytes is regulated by futile cycling via sulfotransferase and arylsulfatase. Thus, drugs and endogenous substances that affect arylsulfatase may have marked effects on sulfate conjugate production by the liver."

TGF-beta had no stimulatory effect on either class of [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycans which appeared in an approximately 1:1 and 2:1 ratio of heparan sulfate to dermatan sulfate of the medium and cell layers, respectively, of arterial endothelial cells. Human adult arterial endothelial cells synthesized little or no chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Pulsechase labeling revealed that the appearance of smooth muscle cell proteoglycans into the medium over a 36-h period equaled the disappearance of labeled proteoglycans from the cell layer, independent of TGF-beta. Inhibitors of RNA synthesis blocked TGF-beta-stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in the smooth muscle cells. The incorporation of [35S]methionine into chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core proteins was stimulated by TGF-beta. Taken together, the results presented indicate that TGF-beta stimulates chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan synthesis in human adult arterial smooth muscle cells by promoting the core protein synthesis."

It was then exposed to an oxygen flux of 223 micromol min(-1) by gassing the growth vessel with 5% O(2). Sulfate reduction persisted under these conditions, though the amount of sulfate reduced decreased by 45% compared to the amount reduced during the initial anaerobic mode. After 1 week of growth under these conditions, sulfate was excluded from the incoming medium. The sulfate concentration in the growth vessel decreased exponentially from 4.1 mM to 2.5 microM. The coculture consumed oxygen effectively, and no residual oxygen was detected during either growth mode in which oxygen was supplied. The proportion of D. oxyclinae cells in the coculture as determined by in situ hybridization decreased from 86% under anaerobic conditions to 70% in the microaerobic sulfate-reducing mode and 34% in the microaerobic sulfate-depleted mode. As determined by the most-probable-number (MPN) method, the numbers of viable D. oxyclinae cells during the two microaerobic growth modes decreased compared to the numbers during the anaerobic growth mode. However, there was no significant difference between the MPN values for the two modes when oxygen was supplied. The patterns of consumption of electron donors and acceptors suggested that when oxygen was supplied in the absence of sulfate and thiosulfate, D. oxyclinae performed incomplete aerobic oxidation of lactate to acetate. This is the first observation of oxygen-dependent growth of a sulfate-reducing bacterium in the absence of either sulfate or thiosulfate. Cells harvested during the microaerobic sulfate-depleted stage and exposed to sulfate and thiosulfate in a respiration chamber were capable of anaerobic sulfate and thiosulfate reduction."

By estimating equilibrium populations of structurally stable and unstable protofibrils, we determine the shift in the dominant population from free monomer to ordered fibril at a critical nucleus of ten chains for the C(2x) and C(2z) forms. We find that a minimum assembly of 16 monomer chains is necessary to mimic a mature fibril, and show that its structural stability correlates with a plateau in the hydrophobic residue density and a decrease in the likelihood of losing hydrophobic interactions by rotating the fibril subunits. While Abeta(1-40) protofibrils show similar structural stability for both C(2x) and C(2z) quaternary structures, we find that the fibril elongation propensity is greater for the C(2z) form relative to the C(2x) form. We attribute the increased propensity for elongation of the C(2z) form as being due to a stagger in the interdigitation of the N-terminal and C-terminal beta-strands, resulting in structural asymmetry in the presented fibril ends that decreases the amount of incorrect addition to the N terminus on one end. We show that because different combinations of stagger and quaternary structure affect the structural symmetry of the fibril end, we propose that differences in quaternary structures will affect directional growth patterns and possibly different morphologies in the mature fiber."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta. Spectroscopic data were consistent with this assumption. The present study proves that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta plays a key role in stabilizing the deoxy T structure and consequently in co-operative oxygen binding."

Since then, there has been an ongoing debate about whether Hb allostery involves the unliganded tense T state and the liganded relaxed R state or whether it involves the T state and an ensemble of liganded relaxed states. In fact, the former model is inconsistent with many functional observations, as well as the recent discoveries of several relaxed-state Hb structures such as RR2, R3 and R2. One school of thought has suggested the R2 state to be the physiologically relevant relaxed end state, with the R state mediating the T-->R2 transition. X-ray studies have been performed on human carbonmonoxy Hb at a resolution of 2.8 A. The ensuing liganded quaternary structure is different from previously reported liganded Hb structures. The distal beta-heme pocket is the largest when compared with other liganded Hb structures, partly owing to rotation of betaHis63(E7) out of the distal pocket, creating a ligand channel to the solvent. The structure also shows unusually smaller alpha- and beta-clefts. Results from this study taken in conjunction with previous findings suggest that multiple liganded Hb states with different quaternary structures may be involved in ligand uptake, stabilization, transport and release."

The aim of this study was to modify existing purification and enrichment techniques to isolate alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs preferentially from the mouse hippocampus and to identify the alpha 5 subunit by using tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The results showed that the detergent solubility of the alpha 5 subunits was distinct from that of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, and the relative distribution of the alpha 5 subunits in Triton X-100-soluble fractions was correlated with that of the extracellular protein radixin but not with that of the postsynaptic protein gephyrin. Mass spectrometry identified the alpha 5 subunit and showed that this subunit associates with multiple alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, but most frequently the beta 3 subunit. Thus, the alpha 5 subunits coassemble with similar subunits as their synaptic counterparts yet have a distinct detergent solubility profile.

Increased levels of the alpha 5 and beta 1 subunits are observed in the follicular light zone, suggesting a role for these integrins in B-cell activation. Although the alpha 4 subunit is expressed by all lymphoid cells, an increased expression of alpha 4 and decreased expression of beta 1 by the mantle zone B-cell compartment is noted in comparison with the decreased expression of alpha 4 and increased expression of beta 1 by follicular center B-cells. These studies suggest that alpha 4 may be paired with a beta subunit other than beta 1 on the mantle zone lymphoid population. Thus, integrin expression by cells of lymphoid tissues varies with location and function and differs significantly from integrin expression observed on circulating and cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes."

Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of CT and LT molecules can inhibit TNF-alpha release by macrophages. The results obtained in this study showed that CT and LT are both, in a dose dependent manner, able either to induce or inhibit TNF-alpha release by murine macrophages and primary human monocytes. The results also showed that recombinant B subunits of CT and LT in the absence of their A subunit induce high levels of TNF-alpha release by macrophages and, in addition, increase the level of TNF-alpha release induced by LPS. The ability of both B subunits (CTB and LTB) in inducing TNF-alpha release by macrophages is not related to the level of LPS contamination, since direct measurements of LPS made in the samples employed in this study showed only traces of LPS (3.4 x 10(-8) EU/ml) which is in our system does not induce TNF-alpha release by macrophages. In contrast to the results obtained with the B subunits, incubation of cells with the A subunit of CT (CTA) inhibit TNF-alpha release induced by native CT, native LT, recombinant LTB and LPS. This inhibitory effect must be related to the activity of the A subunit since viability tests performed in terms of metabolic rate demonstrated that high concentrations of CTA are not toxic to the cells. The data presented herein demonstrate that the A subunits of CT and LT have an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha release in macrophages, whereas their B subunits have a stimulatory effect on TNF-alpha. The results also suggest that the dose dependent bi-modal effect of native CT and native LT on TNF-alpha release by macrophages is a result of the combined effect of their individual A and B subunits."

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

Previous mutational studies on Tyr42alpha variants as well as the current studies on the mutant hemoglobin alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions associated with Tyr42alpha significantly stabilize the alpha1beta2 interface of the quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

The effects of intermolecular contacts on the structure were investigated; such contacts cause only highly localized distortions, as judged from the degree of molecular asymmetry that they induce. The geometry of the iron-nitrogen complex closely resembles that of the deoxymyoglobin structure of Takano (1977) and of the 5-co-ordinated model compounds of Hoard (1975) and Jameson et al. (1980). The distance of the iron from the mean plane of N(porphyrin) is 0.40(5) A and 0.36(5) A, respectively, at the alpha and beta haems, in contrast to the corresponding distance of +0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A in oxyhaemoglobin ( Shaanan , 1983); the Fe-N epsilon (F8) bond length is 2.12(4) A and the Fe-N(porphyrin) bond length is 2.06(2) A; the last is also in good agreement with extended X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurements on deoxyhaemoglobin ( Eisenberger et al., 1978; Perutz et al., 1982). The haems are domed toward the proximal side; the separation between the mean planes of N(porphyrin) and C(porphyrin) being 0.16(6) A and 0.10(6) A, respectively at the alpha and beta haems. At the alpha haems, the normals to the mean pyrrole planes are tilted uniformly toward the haem centre, by about three degrees relative to the haem normal, and there is a folding of about four degrees of the haem about an axis running between the methene carbons that are between the pyrrole rings bearing like-type side-chains. At the beta haems, there is no such folding, and only pyrroles II and IV (those eclipsed by His F8) are appreciably tilted, by about eight degrees. The independence of these parameters from restraints imposed on the model was verified by unrestrained refinement of the entire molecule starting from a structure with modified haem geometry."

The method involves initial porphyrin esterification and extraction from urine. Detection and quantification is performed from the extracts by separation with a Hypersil BDS column and on-line detection by MS through coupling with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The porphyrin esters are detected as protonated molecules [M + H]+. Their mass spectra also exhibit an [M + Na]+ fragment of lower intensity. The analytical performance of this method is compared with those of LC with UV and fluorescence detection. LC-MS used in selective [M + H]+ ion monitoring provides the lowest detection and quantitation limits. In scan mode, this LC-MS method affords, without further isolation or concentration steps, the measurement of mass spectra of unknown compounds present in the urine of patients with altered porphyrin excretion."

Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule."

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta. Spectroscopic data were consistent with this assumption. The present study proves that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta plays a key role in stabilizing the deoxy T structure and consequently in co-operative oxygen binding."

All the mutants are tetrameric and T-state in the deoxygenated derivative. Reassociation of deoxygenated dimers is not modified by interface mutations. DeoxyHb alpha T38W/beta W37T dissociate much faster. We propose a binding site for I- at the switch region. The single mutants binds O2 cooperatively; the double one is almost non-cooperative, a feature confirmed by CO binding.

It was clarified from the UVRR bands at 1605 and 1166 cm(-)(1) characteristic of tyrosinate that the tyrosine (F8) of the abnormal subunit in Hb M Iwate adopts a deprotonated form. UV Raman bands of other Tyr residues indicated that the protein takes the T-quaternary structure even in the met form. Although both hemes of alpha and beta subunits in metHb A take a six-coordinate (6c) high-spin structure, the 406.7-nm excited RR spectrum of metHb M Iwate indicated that the abnormal alpha subunit adopts a 5c high-spin structure. The present results and our previous observation of the nu(Fe)(-)(O(tyrosine)) Raman band [Nagai et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 2418-2422] have proved that F8-tyrosinate is covalently bound to Fe(III) heme in the alpha subunit of Hb M Iwate. As a result, peripheral groups of porphyrin ring, especially the vinyl and the propionate side chains, were so strongly influenced that the RR spectrum in the low-frequency region excited at 406.7 nm is distinctly changed from the normal pattern. When Hb M Iwate was fully reduced, the characteristic UVRR bands of tyrosinate disappeared and the Raman bands of tyrosine at 1620 (Y8a), 1207 (Y7a), and 1177 cm(-)(1) (Y9a) increased in intensity. Coordination of distal His(E7) to the Fe(II) heme in the reduced alpha subunit of Hb M Iwate was proved by the observation of the nu(Fe)(-)(His) RR band in the 441.6-nm excited RR spectrum at the same frequency as that of its isolated alpha chain. The effects of the distal-His coordination on the heme appeared as a distortion of the peripheral groups of heme.

Thus, muscle oxygenation states during exercise might differ between patients with COPD and healthy individuals. We simultaneously measured oxygenation state and pHi in the muscles of patients with COPD during the transition from rest to exercise (on-transition) using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and (31)P-MRS. Sixteen patients with COPD (aged 68.6 +/- 7.5 years) and 7 healthy males (controls; aged 63.3 +/- 7.5 years) performed dynamic handgrip exercise (lifting a weight by gripping at a rate of 20 grips per min for 3 min). Patients were classified based on pHi data at the completion of exercise as having a normal (>or= 6.9; n = 8) or a low (< 6.9; n = 8) pHi. The deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (deoxy-Hb/Mb) in NIRS recordings remained constant or slightly decreased initially (time delay), then increased to reach a plateau. We calculated the time delay and the time constant of deoxy-Hb/Mb kinetics during the on-transition. The time delay was shorter in the group with a low pHi than in the controls. These findings might reflect a slower increase in O(2) delivery in patients with a low pHi, which might partly account for altered muscle energy metabolism."

Biochemical confirmation of the diagnosis can be difficult, particularly in patients without neurologic dysfunction at the time of testing. The demonstration of increased fecal excretion of porphyrin is frequently used for this purpose, but levels may be normal. Since elevated fecal porphyrin levels in variegate porphyria are presumably a consequence of increased biliary excretion, we evaluated whether analysis of porphyrins in bile distinguishes better between patients with variegate porphyria and controls."

Two methods of electrode modification were applied: direct chemisorption and embedment into dodecanethiol monolayer. Both types of electrodes were used for detection of L-histidine using Osteryoung square-wave voltammetry. The sensitivity of sensors presented towards L-histidine depends on the method of electrode modification. The detection limits observed for the electrodes incorporating with Fe(III)-porphyrin host by embedment and chemisorption were in 1 and 100 nM ranges, respectively. In addition, the determination of L-histidine with electrode modified by embedment technique was more precise, in comparison to that obtained by the direct chemisorption. Applicability of gold electrodes modified with Fe(III)-porphyrin for the direct electrochemical determination of L-histidine was demonstrated using the artificial matrix mimicking human serum."

The method involves initial porphyrin esterification and extraction from urine. Detection and quantification is performed from the extracts by separation with a Hypersil BDS column and on-line detection by MS through coupling with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The porphyrin esters are detected as protonated molecules [M + H]+. Their mass spectra also exhibit an [M + Na]+ fragment of lower intensity. The analytical performance of this method is compared with those of LC with UV and fluorescence detection. LC-MS used in selective [M + H]+ ion monitoring provides the lowest detection and quantitation limits. In scan mode, this LC-MS method affords, without further isolation or concentration steps, the measurement of mass spectra of unknown compounds present in the urine of patients with altered porphyrin excretion."

The structure of human deoxyhaemoglobin was refined at 1.74 A resolution using data collected on film at room temperature from a synchrotron X-ray source. The crystallographic R-factor is 16.0%. The estimated error in atomic positions is 0.1 A overall, 0.14 A for main-chain atoms of internal segments, and 0.05 A for the iron atoms. The effects of intermolecular contacts on the structure were investigated; such contacts cause only highly localized distortions, as judged from the degree of molecular asymmetry that they induce. The geometry of the iron-nitrogen complex closely resembles that of the deoxymyoglobin structure of Takano (1977) and of the 5-co-ordinated model compounds of Hoard (1975) and Jameson et al. (1980). The distance of the iron from the mean plane of N(porphyrin) is 0.40(5) A and 0.36(5) A, respectively, at the alpha and beta haems, in contrast to the corresponding distance of +0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A in oxyhaemoglobin ( Shaanan , 1983); the Fe-N epsilon (F8) bond length is 2.12(4) A and the Fe-N(porphyrin) bond length is 2.06(2) A; the last is also in good agreement with extended X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurements on deoxyhaemoglobin ( Eisenberger et al., 1978; Perutz et al., 1982). The haems are domed toward the proximal side; the separation between the mean planes of N(porphyrin) and C(porphyrin) being 0.16(6) A and 0.10(6) A, respectively at the alpha and beta haems. At the alpha haems, the normals to the mean pyrrole planes are tilted uniformly toward the haem centre, by about three degrees relative to the haem normal, and there is a folding of about four degrees of the haem about an axis running between the methene carbons that are between the pyrrole rings bearing like-type side-chains. At the beta haems, there is no such folding, and only pyrroles II and IV (those eclipsed by His F8) are appreciably tilted, by about eight degrees. The independence of these parameters from restraints imposed on the model was verified by unrestrained refinement of the entire molecule starting from a structure with modified haem geometry."

The reaction of acyl chlorides generated in situ with ethyl diazoacetate in the presence of PPh(3) led to the corresponding phosphazine, which was quickly self-transformed into a novel porphyrin beta-keto ester system in up to 78% yield. Comparative studies of the next homologue of acrylic porphyrins, i.e., those bearing an additional CH(2) group next to the double bond of the alpha,beta-unsaturated fragment, showed that these can undergo rearrangement reactions via vinylketenes to yield both regioisomers. Depending on the reaction conditions, this method gives regioselectively access to either a rearrangement product or the product of esterification reactions in yields of 81% or 57%, respectively.

The unique characteristics of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs have been examined with pharmacological, immunostaining, and electrophysiological techniques; however, little is known about their biochemical properties. The aim of this study was to modify existing purification and enrichment techniques to isolate alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs preferentially from the mouse hippocampus and to identify the alpha 5 subunit by using tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The results showed that the detergent solubility of the alpha 5 subunits was distinct from that of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, and the relative distribution of the alpha 5 subunits in Triton X-100-soluble fractions was correlated with that of the extracellular protein radixin but not with that of the postsynaptic protein gephyrin. Mass spectrometry identified the alpha 5 subunit and showed that this subunit associates with multiple alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, but most frequently the beta 3 subunit. Thus, the alpha 5 subunits coassemble with similar subunits as their synaptic counterparts yet have a distinct detergent solubility profile. Mass spectroscopy now offers a method for detecting and characterizing factors that confer the unique detergent solubility and possibly cellular location of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs in hippocampal neurons."

Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of CT and LT molecules can inhibit TNF-alpha release by macrophages. The results obtained in this study showed that CT and LT are both, in a dose dependent manner, able either to induce or inhibit TNF-alpha release by murine macrophages and primary human monocytes. The results also showed that recombinant B subunits of CT and LT in the absence of their A subunit induce high levels of TNF-alpha release by macrophages and, in addition, increase the level of TNF-alpha release induced by LPS. The ability of both B subunits (CTB and LTB) in inducing TNF-alpha release by macrophages is not related to the level of LPS contamination, since direct measurements of LPS made in the samples employed in this study showed only traces of LPS (3.4 x 10(-8) EU/ml) which is in our system does not induce TNF-alpha release by macrophages. In contrast to the results obtained with the B subunits, incubation of cells with the A subunit of CT (CTA) inhibit TNF-alpha release induced by native CT, native LT, recombinant LTB and LPS. This inhibitory effect must be related to the activity of the A subunit since viability tests performed in terms of metabolic rate demonstrated that high concentrations of CTA are not toxic to the cells. The data presented herein demonstrate that the A subunits of CT and LT have an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha release in macrophages, whereas their B subunits have a stimulatory effect on TNF-alpha. The results also suggest that the dose dependent bi-modal effect of native CT and native LT on TNF-alpha release by macrophages is a result of the combined effect of their individual A and B subunits."

The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced.

Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A.

Previous mutational studies on Tyr42alpha variants as well as the current studies on the mutant hemoglobin alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions associated with Tyr42alpha significantly stabilize the alpha1beta2 interface of the quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin."

            "article": "Crystallographic evidence for a new ensemble of ligand-induced allosteric transitions in hemoglobin: the T-to-T(high) quaternary transitions. A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

Using a polarizable force field, we find that polarization energy, i.e., the stabilization a charge feels due to its environment, is larger at the interface than in the bulk for both a positive and a negative charge. The combination of the charge being more stabilized at the interface and the Coulomb attraction between the charges results in a barrier to charge separation at the pentacene/C60 interface that can be in excess of 0.7 eV for static configurations of the donor and acceptor locations. However, the impact of molecular motions, i.e., the dynamics, at the interface at room temperature results in a distribution of polarization energies and in charge separation barriers that can be significantly reduced. The dynamic nature of the interface is thus critical, with the polarization energy distributions indicating that sites along the interface shift in time between favorable and unfavorable configurations for charge separation.

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

Our recent studies have indicated that human Polkappa is capable of both error-free and error-prone translesion DNA synthesis in vitro. However, it is not known whether human Polkappa also plays a role in untargeted mutagenesis. To examine this possibility, we have measured the fidelity of human Polkappa during DNA synthesis from undamaged templates. Using kinetic measurements of nucleotide incorporations and a fidelity assay with gapped M13mp2 DNA, we show that human Polkappa synthesizes DNA with extraordinarily low fidelity. At the lacZalpha target gene, human Polkappa made on average one error for every 200 nucleotides synthesized, with a predominant T-->G transversion mutation at a rate of 1/147. The overall error rate of human Polkappa is 1.7-fold lower than human Poleta, but 33-fold higher than human Polbeta, a DNA polymerase with very low fidelity. Thus, human Polkappa is one of the most inaccurate DNA polymerases known. These results support a role for human Polkappa in untargeted mutagenesis surrounding a DNA lesion and in DNA regions without damage."

In three separate experiments using two different regions of human elastin cDNAs, the distribution of grains was found to be concentrated on the long arm of chromosome 7 within the [q11.1-21.1] region, and the peak number of grains coincided with the locus 7q11.2. Second, hybridizations with a panel of human-rodent cell hybrids showed concordance with human chromosome 7. Third, PCR analyses with elastin-specific primers of DNA from a hybrid cell line containing chromosome 7 as the only human chromosome yielded a product of the expected size, while DNA containing human chromosome 2, but not chromosome 7, did not result in a product. The results indicate that the human elastin gene is located in the proximal region of the long arm of chromosome 7. The precise localization of the elastin gene in the human genome is useful in establishing genetic linkage between inheritance of an allele with a mutated elastin gene and a heritable disorder."

Chromosome integrity is assessed by comparing the peak position of a human chromosome in the flow karyotypes of a hybrid cell line and its human donor. When human donor cells are unavailable, the peak position of a human chromosome in a hybrid line is compared to the range of peak positions among normal individuals. The relative frequency of human chromosomes in subclones or hybrids grown in culture is monitored using the volumes of peaks in flow karyotypes.

The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect.

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta. Spectroscopic data were consistent with this assumption. The present study proves that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta plays a key role in stabilizing the deoxy T structure and consequently in co-operative oxygen binding."

Two sets of curves have been obtained, which have been analyzed by either singular or global procedures for estimating the enthalpy changes of subsequent steps of oxygenation. The data indicate that in human hemoglobin the reaction with oxygen is enthalpy driven for steps 1, 2, and 4 while it is entropy driven for step 3. In bovine hemoglobin this phenomenon is even more evident: steps 2 and 4 are enthalpy driven while steps 1 and 3 are entropy driven.

VO2max declined with decreasing [Hb], but the relationship between VO2max and both the effluent venous PO2 (PvO2) and the calculated mean capillary PO2 (PcO2) was not linear through the origin and, therefore, not compatible with a single value of DmO2 (as calculated by Bohr integration using a model based on Fick's law of diffusion).

In these experiments, the relationship between VO2max and both PvO2 and calculated PcO2 for each [Hb] was consistent with a constant estimate of DmO2 as PaO2 was reduced, but the calculated DmO2 for the lower [Hb] was 33% less than that at the higher [Hb] (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta. Spectroscopic data were consistent with this assumption. The present study proves that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta plays a key role in stabilizing the deoxy T structure and consequently in co-operative oxygen binding."

Studies using (31)-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) have shown that phosphocreatine (PCr) and muscle pH (pHi) are significantly decreased in patients with COPD during mild exercise, suggesting the early activation of anaerobic glycolysis in their muscles. Thus, muscle oxygenation states during exercise might differ between patients with COPD and healthy individuals. We simultaneously measured oxygenation state and pHi in the muscles of patients with COPD during the transition from rest to exercise (on-transition) using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and (31)P-MRS. Sixteen patients with COPD (aged 68.6 +/- 7.5 years) and 7 healthy males (controls; aged 63.3 +/- 7.5 years) performed dynamic handgrip exercise (lifting a weight by gripping at a rate of 20 grips per min for 3 min). Patients were classified based on pHi data at the completion of exercise as having a normal (>or= 6.9; n = 8) or a low (< 6.9; n = 8) pHi. The deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (deoxy-Hb/Mb) in NIRS recordings remained constant or slightly decreased initially (time delay), then increased to reach a plateau. We calculated the time delay and the time constant of deoxy-Hb/Mb kinetics during the on-transition. The time delay was shorter in the group with a low pHi than in the controls. These findings might reflect a slower increase in O(2) delivery in patients with a low pHi, which might partly account for altered muscle energy metabolism."

Ten males and ten females participated in this study. Subjects performed RRH for 9 min, and then rested for 20 min with PL- or placebo-irradiations. After rest, they again performed RRH for 3 min. As evaluation parameters, we selected the sustained force curve during RRH, subjective muscle-fatigue sensation (Fs), blood lactate concentration (La), muscle oxygenation (Total Hb, Oxy-Hb, and Deoxy-Hb), and skin temperature. The decreasing rate of the integrated area for 30 sec during RRH was significantly smaller in the PL-irradiation than with the placebo. There were no significant differences between irradiation conditions for fatigue sensation and lactate concentration skin temperature during rest was kept high by PL-irradiation. Muscle oxygenation tended to remain slightly high during the initial phase (1-8 min after the exercise).

The similarity (correlation) between measurements with far and near source-detector separations collected during the rest period before visual stimulation was used as indicator of global interference dominance. A detailed analysis of CNR improvement in oxy-hemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb), as a function of the rest period correlation coefficient, is presented. Results show that for O(2)Hb measurements, 66% exhibited substantial global interference. For this dataset, dominated by global interference, 71% of the measurements revealed CNR improvements after adaptive filtering, with a mean CNR improvement of 60%. No CNR improvement was observed for HHb.

Cytotoxicity was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release and fluorescence assays. Pure Hb or hemolysate caused dose- and time-dependent increases in HO-1 mRNA and protein. Hemin was the component of Hb that increased HO-1 mRNA. Cycloheximide inhibited the increase in HO-1 mRNA in response to hemin. Ferritin protein heavy chain but not mRNA increased upon exposure of cells to Hb. Hemin and ferric but not ferrous Hb were toxic to smooth muscle cells.

Using intact hepatocytes or homogenates of hepatocytes, compounds were identified that either inhibited 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate hydrolysis via arylsulfatase or impaired its uptake into cells. For example, sodium sulfate inhibited hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by intact hepatocytes (half-maximal inhibition, 0.1 mM) but not by homogenates, suggesting a selective action on organic sulfate uptake at the plasma membrane. In contrast, cholesterol sulfate inhibited hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by homogenates but not by hepatocytes, consistent with the hypothesis that cholesterol sulfate does not readily enter intact cells. Compounds that inhibited hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by both isolated hepatocytes and microsomes include sodium sulfite (half-maximal inhibition, 0.1 mM), pregnenolone sulfate (half-maximal inhibition, 1 microM), and estrone sulfate (half-maximal inhibition, 10 microM). To test whether production of sulfate conjugates could be modified by agents affecting arylsulfatase in intact hepatocytes, we examined the effects of pregnenolone sulfate on the production of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate from 4-methylumbelliferone. Addition of pregnenolone sulfate (100 microM) to intact cells increased rates of 4-methylumbelliferone sulfate production and decreased the fraction of 4-methylumbelliferone converted into the glucuronide. Hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by isolated microsomes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) when cytosol, a source of sulfotransferase was present. Furthermore, addition of low concentrations of PAPS (0.5 microM) to a reconstituted system of microsomes and cytosol impaired the formation of fluorescent product from 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate until PAPS was consumed, indicating that futile cycling via arylsulfatase and sulfotransferase occurred. Subsequent futile cycling of free 4-methylumbelliferone and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate occurred upon repeated additions of PAPS and was prevented by sodium sulfite, an inhibitor of arylsulfatase. These results argue strongly that sulfate conjugate production within hepatocytes is regulated by futile cycling via sulfotransferase and arylsulfatase. Thus, drugs and endogenous substances that affect arylsulfatase may have marked effects on sulfate conjugate production by the liver."

However, TGF-beta consistently stimulated the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Both chondroitin 4- and chondroitin 6-sulfate were stimulated by TGF-beta to the same extent.

Pulsechase labeling revealed that the appearance of smooth muscle cell proteoglycans into the medium over a 36-h period equaled the disappearance of labeled proteoglycans from the cell layer, independent of TGF-beta.

During the control period subjects in this investigation exhibited higher serum sulfate concentrations and lower sulfate renal clearance values than reported for younger subjects with normal renal function.

Sulindac therapy also increased the serum sulfate concentration and decreased the clearance of sulfate; a similar trend was observed after naproxen therapy but the average change was smaller and not statistically significant. There were significant correlations between the creatinine and the sulfate clearances or serum concentrations. The glomerular filtration rate of inorganic sulfate was not altered by drug treatment and there was no impairment of reabsorption. The serum concentrations and renal clearance of other electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus) were largely unaffected.

Therefore, there is interest in defining the features of both molecules that are critical for their interaction. We employed a recently described competitive microassay that measures initial binding of proteoglycan to immobilized LDL. We confirmed the work of others that it is the apolipoprotein B component and, at least in part, a heparin-binding domain of LDL that are responsible for binding chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. The principal thrust of our study was concerned with the effects of a glycosaminoglycan's degree of sulfation on the binding to LDL. Initial experiments comparing dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans indicated that the former was more efficient at binding LDL than the latter and that oversulfation, rather than chain length or iduronate content, was the preeminent feature involved. Additional binding studies with dermatan sulfate, chemically sulfated chondroitin-4-sulfate, and naturally occurring oversulfated chondroitin sulfates indicated that the degree of sulfation, not the position of sulfation, determined affinity for LDL. These results suggest that studies should be undertaken to determine whether oversulfated segments of glycosaminoglycans are especially involved in associations with LDL, leading to lipid accumulation, in the artery wall."

TR heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds efficiently to the thyroid hormone (T(3)) response element (TRE) of target genes. In the absence of T(3), unliganded TR suppresses the basal promoter activity of positively regulated genes (silencing). Silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) interact with unliganded TR and function as corepressor proteins. Previously, we found beta F451X with carboxyl (C)-terminal 11-amino acid deletion had stronger silencing potency than wild-type TR beta 1 and beta E449X with C-terminal 13-amino acid deletion on a subset of TREs. In the present study, to assess the isoform-specific effects of the C-terminal truncations on TR silencing, we constructed two mutant TR alpha 1s (alpha F397X and alpha E395X) with the same respective C-terminal truncations as beta F451X and beta E449X and analysed their silencing activities. Unlike beta F451X and beta E449X, alpha F397X and alpha E395X showed similarly stronger silencing potency than wild-type TR alpha 1. We further studied the abilities of wild-type and the mutant TR beta 1s and alpha 1s on RXR and co-repressor binding by a two-hybrid interference assay. beta F451X had significantly stronger abilities to bind to RXR and SMRT than did wild-type TR beta 1 and beta E449X. In contrast, wild-type TR alpha 1, alpha F397X and alpha E395X showed similar abilities to bind to RXR and SMRT. beta E449X and alpha E395X, which have identical C-terminal truncation, showed less ability to bind to N-CoR than did wild-type TR beta 1 and beta F451X and wild-type TR alpha 1 and alpha F397X respectively. These results indicate that an identical C-terminal truncation gives rise to different effects on TR beta 1 and alpha1 with respect to silencing potency, RXR binding and SMRT binding. The difference in the silencing potency among wild-type TR beta 1, beta F451X and beta E449X correlated well with the difference in the ability to bind co-repressor SMRT."

The unique characteristics of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs have been examined with pharmacological, immunostaining, and electrophysiological techniques; however, little is known about their biochemical properties. The aim of this study was to modify existing purification and enrichment techniques to isolate alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs preferentially from the mouse hippocampus and to identify the alpha 5 subunit by using tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The results showed that the detergent solubility of the alpha 5 subunits was distinct from that of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, and the relative distribution of the alpha 5 subunits in Triton X-100-soluble fractions was correlated with that of the extracellular protein radixin but not with that of the postsynaptic protein gephyrin. Mass spectrometry identified the alpha 5 subunit and showed that this subunit associates with multiple alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, but most frequently the beta 3 subunit. Thus, the alpha 5 subunits coassemble with similar subunits as their synaptic counterparts yet have a distinct detergent solubility profile. Mass spectroscopy now offers a method for detecting and characterizing factors that confer the unique detergent solubility and possibly cellular location of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs in hippocampal neurons."

Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of CT and LT molecules can inhibit TNF-alpha release by macrophages. The results obtained in this study showed that CT and LT are both, in a dose dependent manner, able either to induce or inhibit TNF-alpha release by murine macrophages and primary human monocytes. The results also showed that recombinant B subunits of CT and LT in the absence of their A subunit induce high levels of TNF-alpha release by macrophages and, in addition, increase the level of TNF-alpha release induced by LPS. The ability of both B subunits (CTB and LTB) in inducing TNF-alpha release by macrophages is not related to the level of LPS contamination, since direct measurements of LPS made in the samples employed in this study showed only traces of LPS (3.4 x 10(-8) EU/ml) which is in our system does not induce TNF-alpha release by macrophages. In contrast to the results obtained with the B subunits, incubation of cells with the A subunit of CT (CTA) inhibit TNF-alpha release induced by native CT, native LT, recombinant LTB and LPS. This inhibitory effect must be related to the activity of the A subunit since viability tests performed in terms of metabolic rate demonstrated that high concentrations of CTA are not toxic to the cells. The data presented herein demonstrate that the A subunits of CT and LT have an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha release in macrophages, whereas their B subunits have a stimulatory effect on TNF-alpha. The results also suggest that the dose dependent bi-modal effect of native CT and native LT on TNF-alpha release by macrophages is a result of the combined effect of their individual A and B subunits."

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

As demonstration of the use of capacitive electrodes for SSVEP measurements, preliminary online Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) results of the system are presented. Detection times lie about a factor of 3 higher than in galvanic EEG SSVEP measurements, but are low enough to establish a proper communication channel for Human Machine Interface (HMI)."

The catalytic triad of KSHV Pr, (Ser114, His46, and His157) and transition-state stabilization site are arranged as in other structurally characterized herpesviral proteases. The distal histidine-histidine hydrogen bond is solvent accessible, unlike the situation in other classes of serine proteases. As in all herpesviral proteases, the enzyme is active only as a weakly associated dimer (K(d) approximately 2 microM), and inactive as a monomer. Therefore, both the active site and dimer interface are potential targets for antiviral drug design. The dimer interface in KSHV Pr is compared with the interface of other herpesviral proteases. Two conserved arginines (Arg209), one from each monomer, are buried within the same region of the dimer interface. We propose that this conserved arginine may provide a destabilizing element contributing to the tuned micromolar dissociation of herpesviral protease dimers."

It starts by considering virus invasion of cultivated plants from their wild ancestors in the centres of plant domestication in different parts of the world and subsequent long distance movement away from these centres to other continents. It then describes the diverse virus-plant pathosystem scenarios possible at the interface between managed and natural vegetation and gives examples that illustrate situations where indigenous viruses emerge to damage introduced cultivated plants and newly introduced viruses become potential threats to biodiversity. These examples demonstrate how human activities increasingly facilitate damaging new encounters between plants and viruses worldwide. The likely effects of climate change on virus emergence are emphasised, and the major factors driving virus emergence, evolution and greater epidemic severity at the interface are analysed and explained. Finally, the kinds of challenges posed by rapidly changing world conditions to achieving effective control of epidemics of emerging plant viruses, and the approaches needed to address them, are described."

Their morphological features, ultra-structural characteristics at the heterologous cell interface, and the deposition of basement-membrane molecules [laminin, type-IV collagen, heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)] at the epithelial-stromal junction were analyzed. The 2 cell lines behaved differently. HT29 cells did not spread on the fibroblasts and grew as clusters, while Caco-2 cells formed a monolayer over the fibroblastic feeder layer. Only the latter carcinoma cells exhibited cytoplasmic processes towards the fibroblasts and, after 5 days in co-cultures, a structured basement membrane (BM). The immunocytochemical analysis of the BM constituents revealed the absence of the molecules studied at the sites of heterologous contacts in the case of HT29 cells. In contrast, in the co-cultures comprising Caco-2 cells, laminin and type-IV collagen were progressively deposited in a polar fashion at the epithelial-fibroblastic interface which, however, remained devoid of HSPG molecules. Together with earlier data indicating a dual origin of the BM molecules located at the epithelial-fibroblastic interface in normal intestine, the present study shows that the cancer cells as well as the fibroblastic ones under the influence of carcinoma cells display an altered capacity to synthesize and/or secrete BM molecules. The extent of such abnormalities correlates with the differentiation of the cells. Finally, these modifications occur concomitantly with alterations in cell interactions which vary among cell lines."

The central theme of an immersive/telepresence design approach is that the world may be displayed to a user as if that person were physically present in a computermediated world. However, the ability of SEs to re-create a computer-mediated world by using immersive displays does not annul the responsibility of designers to tailor interfaces to meet the task-dependant needs of users. Whether functioning in reality or a virtual reality, interfaces must satisfy user information requirements to optimize performance. It does not necessarily follow that the combination of immersive interfaces, strict reproduction of the remote world, and telepresence gives users the most efficient human-machine interface. Other aspects of human behavior, such as concentration and attentional resource allocation or situation awareness, which are not necessarily encompassed by the concept of telepresence, need to be considered in the interface design."

Previous mutational studies on Tyr42alpha variants as well as the current studies on the mutant hemoglobin alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions associated with Tyr42alpha significantly stabilize the alpha1beta2 interface of the quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin."

Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta. Spectroscopic data were consistent with this assumption.

We highlight the current available methods to study allostery and their applications in studies of conformational mechanisms, disease, and allosteric drug discovery. We outline the challenges and future directions that we foresee.

The compression is presumed to be sufficiently slow that the density remains uniform within each fluid and hence depends only on time. The perturbation is taken to be sinusoidal with amplitude h(t). The time evolution of h is determined by requiring pressure continuity across the interface in the usual way. The resulting linearized stability equation is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation for h(t). Compared to the corresponding well-known result for incompressible fluids, it is found that normal compression has the effect of reducing the perturbation growth rate &hdot; by an obvious geometrical correction, while transverse compression does not directly affect the net growth rate but rather has the dynamical effect of increasing its time derivative. When attention is focused on the masses transported across the initial interface rather than h, the purely geometrical effects of compression no longer appear explicitly, while the dynamical effects remain. It is thereby shown that both normal and transverse compression dynamically enhance the mixing of material masses, in spite of the corresponding purely geometrical reduction in &hdot;."

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) is very well obeyed in the native protein, but not around the site of the changed residue in the mutant.

Studies using (31)-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) have shown that phosphocreatine (PCr) and muscle pH (pHi) are significantly decreased in patients with COPD during mild exercise, suggesting the early activation of anaerobic glycolysis in their muscles. Thus, muscle oxygenation states during exercise might differ between patients with COPD and healthy individuals. We simultaneously measured oxygenation state and pHi in the muscles of patients with COPD during the transition from rest to exercise (on-transition) using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and (31)P-MRS. Sixteen patients with COPD (aged 68.6 +/- 7.5 years) and 7 healthy males (controls; aged 63.3 +/- 7.5 years) performed dynamic handgrip exercise (lifting a weight by gripping at a rate of 20 grips per min for 3 min). Patients were classified based on pHi data at the completion of exercise as having a normal (>or= 6.9; n = 8) or a low (< 6.9; n = 8) pHi. The deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (deoxy-Hb/Mb) in NIRS recordings remained constant or slightly decreased initially (time delay), then increased to reach a plateau. We calculated the time delay and the time constant of deoxy-Hb/Mb kinetics during the on-transition. The time delay was shorter in the group with a low pHi than in the controls. These findings might reflect a slower increase in O(2) delivery in patients with a low pHi, which might partly account for altered muscle energy metabolism."

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of PL-irradiation on muscle fatigue recovery and physiological response in the upper limbs after maximal repeated rhythmic hand gripping (RRH). Ten males and ten females participated in this study. Subjects performed RRH for 9 min, and then rested for 20 min with PL- or placebo-irradiations. After rest, they again performed RRH for 3 min. As evaluation parameters, we selected the sustained force curve during RRH, subjective muscle-fatigue sensation (Fs), blood lactate concentration (La), muscle oxygenation (Total Hb, Oxy-Hb, and Deoxy-Hb), and skin temperature. The decreasing rate of the integrated area for 30 sec during RRH was significantly smaller in the PL-irradiation than with the placebo. There were no significant differences between irradiation conditions for fatigue sensation and lactate concentration skin temperature during rest was kept high by PL-irradiation. Muscle oxygenation tended to remain slightly high during the initial phase (1-8 min after the exercise). It is inferred that PL-irradiation maintains a high skin temperature and blood flow, but it may not contribute to recover muscle contraction performance in muscle fatigue."

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

For glucose alone, we also highlight a molecular rearrangement that is not instantaneous and occurs after several minutes. This interfacial organization leads to an unusual giant optical activity that is different with or without SDS.

Their morphological features, ultra-structural characteristics at the heterologous cell interface, and the deposition of basement-membrane molecules [laminin, type-IV collagen, heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)] at the epithelial-stromal junction were analyzed. The 2 cell lines behaved differently. HT29 cells did not spread on the fibroblasts and grew as clusters, while Caco-2 cells formed a monolayer over the fibroblastic feeder layer. Only the latter carcinoma cells exhibited cytoplasmic processes towards the fibroblasts and, after 5 days in co-cultures, a structured basement membrane (BM). The immunocytochemical analysis of the BM constituents revealed the absence of the molecules studied at the sites of heterologous contacts in the case of HT29 cells. In contrast, in the co-cultures comprising Caco-2 cells, laminin and type-IV collagen were progressively deposited in a polar fashion at the epithelial-fibroblastic interface which, however, remained devoid of HSPG molecules. Together with earlier data indicating a dual origin of the BM molecules located at the epithelial-fibroblastic interface in normal intestine, the present study shows that the cancer cells as well as the fibroblastic ones under the influence of carcinoma cells display an altered capacity to synthesize and/or secrete BM molecules. The extent of such abnormalities correlates with the differentiation of the cells. Finally, these modifications occur concomitantly with alterations in cell interactions which vary among cell lines."

Using intact hepatocytes or homogenates of hepatocytes, compounds were identified that either inhibited 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate hydrolysis via arylsulfatase or impaired its uptake into cells. For example, sodium sulfate inhibited hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by intact hepatocytes (half-maximal inhibition, 0.1 mM) but not by homogenates, suggesting a selective action on organic sulfate uptake at the plasma membrane. In contrast, cholesterol sulfate inhibited hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by homogenates but not by hepatocytes, consistent with the hypothesis that cholesterol sulfate does not readily enter intact cells. Compounds that inhibited hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by both isolated hepatocytes and microsomes include sodium sulfite (half-maximal inhibition, 0.1 mM), pregnenolone sulfate (half-maximal inhibition, 1 microM), and estrone sulfate (half-maximal inhibition, 10 microM). To test whether production of sulfate conjugates could be modified by agents affecting arylsulfatase in intact hepatocytes, we examined the effects of pregnenolone sulfate on the production of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate from 4-methylumbelliferone. Addition of pregnenolone sulfate (100 microM) to intact cells increased rates of 4-methylumbelliferone sulfate production and decreased the fraction of 4-methylumbelliferone converted into the glucuronide. Hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate by isolated microsomes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) when cytosol, a source of sulfotransferase was present. Furthermore, addition of low concentrations of PAPS (0.5 microM) to a reconstituted system of microsomes and cytosol impaired the formation of fluorescent product from 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate until PAPS was consumed, indicating that futile cycling via arylsulfatase and sulfotransferase occurred. Subsequent futile cycling of free 4-methylumbelliferone and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate occurred upon repeated additions of PAPS and was prevented by sodium sulfite, an inhibitor of arylsulfatase. These results argue strongly that sulfate conjugate production within hepatocytes is regulated by futile cycling via sulfotransferase and arylsulfatase. Thus, drugs and endogenous substances that affect arylsulfatase may have marked effects on sulfate conjugate production by the liver."

Isolated glomeruli presented higher heparan sulfate concentrations than whole kidney (expressed as mg/g dry weight).

However, TGF-beta consistently stimulated the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Both chondroitin 4- and chondroitin 6-sulfate were stimulated by TGF-beta to the same extent. TGF-beta had no stimulatory effect on either class of [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycans which appeared in an approximately 1:1 and 2:1 ratio of heparan sulfate to dermatan sulfate of the medium and cell layers, respectively, of arterial endothelial cells. Human adult arterial endothelial cells synthesized little or no chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Pulsechase labeling revealed that the appearance of smooth muscle cell proteoglycans into the medium over a 36-h period equaled the disappearance of labeled proteoglycans from the cell layer, independent of TGF-beta. Inhibitors of RNA synthesis blocked TGF-beta-stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in the smooth muscle cells. The incorporation of [35S]methionine into chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core proteins was stimulated by TGF-beta.

Sulfate reduction persisted under these conditions, though the amount of sulfate reduced decreased by 45% compared to the amount reduced during the initial anaerobic mode. After 1 week of growth under these conditions, sulfate was excluded from the incoming medium. The sulfate concentration in the growth vessel decreased exponentially from 4.1 mM to 2.5 microM. The coculture consumed oxygen effectively, and no residual oxygen was detected during either growth mode in which oxygen was supplied. The proportion of D. oxyclinae cells in the coculture as determined by in situ hybridization decreased from 86% under anaerobic conditions to 70% in the microaerobic sulfate-reducing mode and 34% in the microaerobic sulfate-depleted mode. As determined by the most-probable-number (MPN) method, the numbers of viable D. oxyclinae cells during the two microaerobic growth modes decreased compared to the numbers during the anaerobic growth mode. However, there was no significant difference between the MPN values for the two modes when oxygen was supplied. The patterns of consumption of electron donors and acceptors suggested that when oxygen was supplied in the absence of sulfate and thiosulfate, D. oxyclinae performed incomplete aerobic oxidation of lactate to acetate. This is the first observation of oxygen-dependent growth of a sulfate-reducing bacterium in the absence of either sulfate or thiosulfate. Cells harvested during the microaerobic sulfate-depleted stage and exposed to sulfate and thiosulfate in a respiration chamber were capable of anaerobic sulfate and thiosulfate reduction."

In this work, we present an in situ ATR FTIR study of synergistic adsorption of sulfate (SO4) and copper (Cu) on goethite, which is representative of the minerals and ions present in mine wastes, acid sulfate soils, and other industrial and agricultural settings. Sulfate adsorption was studied as a function of varying pH, and as a function of increasing concentration in the absence and presence of Cu. The presence of Cu ions in solution had a complex effect on the ability of SO4 ions to be retained on the goethite surface with increasing pH, with complete desorption occurring near pH 7 and 9 in the absence and presence of Cu, respectively. In addition, Cu ions altered the balance of inner vs outer sphere adsorbed SO4. The solid phase partitioning of SO4 at pH 3 and pH 5 was elevated by the presence of Cu; in both cases Cu increased the affinity of SO4 for the goethite surface. Complementary ex situ sorption edge studies of Cu on goethite in the absence and presence of SO4 revealed that the Cu adsorption edge shifted to lower pH (6.3 --> 5.6) in the presence of SO4, consistent with a decrease of the electrostatic repulsion between the goethite surface and adsorbing Cu. Based on the ATR FTIR and bulk sorption data we surmise that the cosorption products of SO4 and Cu at the goethite-water interface were not in the nature of ternary complexes under the conditions studied here. This information is critical for the evaluation of the onset of surface precipitates of copper-hydroxy sulfates as a function of pH and solution concentration."

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta. Spectroscopic data were consistent with this assumption.

The sensor can selectively identify beta-bungarotoxin, when it hydrolyzes a phospholipid monolayer self-assembled at aqueous-LC interface, through orientational responses of LCs. As a result, optical signals that reflect the spatial and temporal distribution of phospholipids during the hydrolysis can therefore be generated in a real-time manner. The sensor is very sensitive and requires less than 5pg of beta-bungarotoxin for the detection. When phospholipase A(2) inhibitors are introduced together with beta-bungarotoxin, no orientational response of LCs can be observed.

Upon IC-21 cell adhesion, Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited by blocking antibodies to the integrin subunits alpha(M) and beta(2). Furthermore, Pyk2 is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to ligation of beta(2) integrins by antibodies.

In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

Previous mutational studies on Tyr42alpha variants as well as the current studies on the mutant hemoglobin alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions associated with Tyr42alpha significantly stabilize the alpha1beta2 interface of the quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin."

The labeling ratio of beta-tubulin to alpha-tubulin (beta/alpha ratio) is reduced by prolonged incubation, prolonged irradiation, urea, high ionic strength, the use of aged tubulin, dilution of tubulin, or large concentrations of colchicine or podophyllotoxin. Glycerol increases the beta/alpha ratio. Limited data with [3H]podophyllotoxin show that it covalently bound with a similar beta/alpha distribution. Vinblastine, on the other hand, exhibits preferential attachment to alpha-tubulin.

The unique characteristics of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs have been examined with pharmacological, immunostaining, and electrophysiological techniques; however, little is known about their biochemical properties. The aim of this study was to modify existing purification and enrichment techniques to isolate alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs preferentially from the mouse hippocampus and to identify the alpha 5 subunit by using tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The results showed that the detergent solubility of the alpha 5 subunits was distinct from that of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, and the relative distribution of the alpha 5 subunits in Triton X-100-soluble fractions was correlated with that of the extracellular protein radixin but not with that of the postsynaptic protein gephyrin. Mass spectrometry identified the alpha 5 subunit and showed that this subunit associates with multiple alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, but most frequently the beta 3 subunit. Thus, the alpha 5 subunits coassemble with similar subunits as their synaptic counterparts yet have a distinct detergent solubility profile. Mass spectroscopy now offers a method for detecting and characterizing factors that confer the unique detergent solubility and possibly cellular location of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs in hippocampal neurons."

Estimates of the molecular weight of neuronal nicotonic receptor macromolecules suggest that these receptors contain at least four subunits but probably not more than five. We have examined the subunit stoichiometry of the chick neuronal alpha 4/n alpha 1 receptor by first using site-directed mutagenesis to create subunits that confer different single channel properties on the receptor. Co-injection with wild-type and mutant subunits led to the appearance of receptors with wild-type, mutant and hybrid conductances.

The dendritic cells of both follicular center and thymic origin express the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6, as well as the beta 1 integrin subunits. Most lymphoid cells in normal tissues do not express the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 subunits, or the alpha v beta 3 integrin.

Increased levels of the alpha 5 and beta 1 subunits are observed in the follicular light zone, suggesting a role for these integrins in B-cell activation. Although the alpha 4 subunit is expressed by all lymphoid cells, an increased expression of alpha 4 and decreased expression of beta 1 by the mantle zone B-cell compartment is noted in comparison with the decreased expression of alpha 4 and increased expression of beta 1 by follicular center B-cells. These studies suggest that alpha 4 may be paired with a beta subunit other than beta 1 on the mantle zone lymphoid population. Thus, integrin expression by cells of lymphoid tissues varies with location and function and differs significantly from integrin expression observed on circulating and cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes."

Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of CT and LT molecules can inhibit TNF-alpha release by macrophages. The results obtained in this study showed that CT and LT are both, in a dose dependent manner, able either to induce or inhibit TNF-alpha release by murine macrophages and primary human monocytes. The results also showed that recombinant B subunits of CT and LT in the absence of their A subunit induce high levels of TNF-alpha release by macrophages and, in addition, increase the level of TNF-alpha release induced by LPS. The ability of both B subunits (CTB and LTB) in inducing TNF-alpha release by macrophages is not related to the level of LPS contamination, since direct measurements of LPS made in the samples employed in this study showed only traces of LPS (3.4 x 10(-8) EU/ml) which is in our system does not induce TNF-alpha release by macrophages. In contrast to the results obtained with the B subunits, incubation of cells with the A subunit of CT (CTA) inhibit TNF-alpha release induced by native CT, native LT, recombinant LTB and LPS. This inhibitory effect must be related to the activity of the A subunit since viability tests performed in terms of metabolic rate demonstrated that high concentrations of CTA are not toxic to the cells. The data presented herein demonstrate that the A subunits of CT and LT have an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha release in macrophages, whereas their B subunits have a stimulatory effect on TNF-alpha. The results also suggest that the dose dependent bi-modal effect of native CT and native LT on TNF-alpha release by macrophages is a result of the combined effect of their individual A and B subunits."

The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule."

Two sets of curves have been obtained, which have been analyzed by either singular or global procedures for estimating the enthalpy changes of subsequent steps of oxygenation. The data indicate that in human hemoglobin the reaction with oxygen is enthalpy driven for steps 1, 2, and 4 while it is entropy driven for step 3. In bovine hemoglobin this phenomenon is even more evident: steps 2 and 4 are enthalpy driven while steps 1 and 3 are entropy driven.

Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) is very well obeyed in the native protein, but not around the site of the changed residue in the mutant. NCS is also not obeyed by the water molecule invariably found in the alpha-chain haem pocket in room-temperature crystal structures of haemoglobin. At 120 K, this water molecule disappears from one alpha chain in the asymmetric unit but not the other."

By site-directed mutagenesis we have altered the distal residues of the alpha subunits and compared the functional properties of these mutant proteins. The rates of various ligands binding to these proteins in the R-state have been reported by Mathews et al. Here, we present the oxygen equilibrium curves of three E11 alpha mutants and the crystal structures of two of these mutants in the deoxy form. Replacing the distal valine residue of alpha-globin with alanine, leucine or isoleucine has no effect on the oxygen affinity of the protein in either quaternary state, in contrast to the equivalent mutations of beta subunits. The crystal structure of the valine E11 alpha----isoleucine mutant shows that the larger E11 residue excludes water from the haem pocket, but causes no significant movement of other amino acid residues. We conclude that the distal valine residue of alpha-globin does not control the oxygen affinity of the protein by sterically hindering ligand binding."

Studies using (31)-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) have shown that phosphocreatine (PCr) and muscle pH (pHi) are significantly decreased in patients with COPD during mild exercise, suggesting the early activation of anaerobic glycolysis in their muscles. Thus, muscle oxygenation states during exercise might differ between patients with COPD and healthy individuals. We simultaneously measured oxygenation state and pHi in the muscles of patients with COPD during the transition from rest to exercise (on-transition) using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and (31)P-MRS. Sixteen patients with COPD (aged 68.6 +/- 7.5 years) and 7 healthy males (controls; aged 63.3 +/- 7.5 years) performed dynamic handgrip exercise (lifting a weight by gripping at a rate of 20 grips per min for 3 min). Patients were classified based on pHi data at the completion of exercise as having a normal (>or= 6.9; n = 8) or a low (< 6.9; n = 8) pHi. The deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (deoxy-Hb/Mb) in NIRS recordings remained constant or slightly decreased initially (time delay), then increased to reach a plateau. We calculated the time delay and the time constant of deoxy-Hb/Mb kinetics during the on-transition. The time delay was shorter in the group with a low pHi than in the controls. These findings might reflect a slower increase in O(2) delivery in patients with a low pHi, which might partly account for altered muscle energy metabolism."

A number of unwanted effects have been observed in human trials, creating doubts about their clinical usefulness. In some subjects, vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow to the vital organs, heart attack, stroke, systemic inflammation, organ damage, and even death, have been attributed to the transfusion of these experimental products. Hb is a well-known pressor agent and strong oxidant, although the full understanding of its intrinsic toxicity is yet to be uncovered. In particular, the complete mechanism of Hb-induced vasoconstriction needs full elucidation. Knowledge of the biological events that trigger the induction of genes upon treatment with redox-active Hb, as well as its catabolism, is still incomplete. It seems that our limited knowledge of free Hb effects in vivo is the main reason for not yet having a viable substitute of human blood. The future for universal red cell substitutes is in the new-generation products that address all of Hb's intrinsic toxicity issues."

Cultured human adult arterial smooth muscle cells synthesized chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and the percent composition of these three proteoglycan subclasses varied to some extent from cell strain to cell strain. However, TGF-beta consistently stimulated the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Both chondroitin 4- and chondroitin 6-sulfate were stimulated by TGF-beta to the same extent. TGF-beta had no stimulatory effect on either class of [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycans which appeared in an approximately 1:1 and 2:1 ratio of heparan sulfate to dermatan sulfate of the medium and cell layers, respectively, of arterial endothelial cells. Human adult arterial endothelial cells synthesized little or no chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Pulsechase labeling revealed that the appearance of smooth muscle cell proteoglycans into the medium over a 36-h period equaled the disappearance of labeled proteoglycans from the cell layer, independent of TGF-beta. Inhibitors of RNA synthesis blocked TGF-beta-stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in the smooth muscle cells. The incorporation of [35S]methionine into chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core proteins was stimulated by TGF-beta. Taken together, the results presented indicate that TGF-beta stimulates chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan synthesis in human adult arterial smooth muscle cells by promoting the core protein synthesis."

Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule."

The cDNA was isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library by hybridization with a DNA probe prepared from rat poly(A)(+) RNA used for the cloning of mouse C4ST cDNA. The cDNA comprises a single open reading frame that predicts a Type II transmembrane protein composed of 352 amino acids. The protein has an amino acid sequence homology of 96% with mouse C4ST. When the cDNA was introduced into a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected in COS-7 cells, the sulfotransferase activity that transfers sulfate to both chondroitin and desulfated dermatan sulfate was overexpressed. Northern blot analysis indicated that human C4ST mRNAs (6.0 and 1.9 kb) are expressed ubiquitously in various adult human tissues. Dot blot analysis has shown that human C4ST is strongly expressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma and peripheral blood leukocytes, whereas strong expression of human chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST) is observed in aorta and testis. These observations suggest that the expression of C4ST and C6ST may be controlled differently in human tissues.

Heparin sulfate inhibited KAF mitogenic activity on all cell types tested and inhibited the ability of KAF to compete with epidermal growth factor for cell surface binding. Interestingly, KAF stimulated the growth of BALB/MK cells at high cell density but failed to stimulate these cells at clonal density. Protein microsequencing of the first 20 NH2-terminal amino acid residues of purified KAF revealed identity to the NH2 terminus of human amphiregulin (AR).

To elucidate the cell biological mechanisms underlying the development of secondary pulmonary hypertension, we studied the effect of hypoxia on GAG synthesis by human lung cells. GAG synthesis was measured by incorporation of [(3)H]glucosamine; GAGs were isolated, purified, and characterized with GAG-degrading enzymes. Fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) synthesized hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates, whereas dermatan sulfate was found only in fibroblasts. Hypoxia did not influence the size or charge of the individual GAGs. However, hypoxia inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-induced [(3)H]glucosamine incorporation in secreted GAGs, especially hyaluronic acid, in VSMCs. In contrast, it stimulated GAG secretion, specifically heparan sulfate, by fibroblasts. Our results indicate that hypoxia induces modifications in GAG synthesis by human lung VSMCs and fibroblasts that may be correlated to pathophysiological manifestations in lung diseases causing hypoxia."

Since heparan sulfate proteoglycan confers a negative charge on the glomerular basement membrane, and either decreased synthesis or loss of this charge causes albuminuria in diabetic animals, we examined the possibility that enalapril prevents albuminuria through glomerular preservation of heparan sulfate in long-term diabetic rats. A total of 22 male Wistar rats were used in the study. Diabetes was induced in 15 rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). The remaining 7 rats received buffer. One week following induction of diabetes, 8 diabetic rats were allowed to drink tap water containing enalapril at a concentration of 50 mg/liter; the remaining 7 diabetic and 7 nondiabetic rats were given only tap water. The drug treatment was continued for 20 weeks. Systolic blood pressure and 24-hr urinary excretion of albumin were measured at 2, 8, 16, and 20 weeks. At the end of 20 weeks, all rats were killed, kidneys were removed, and glomeruli were isolated by differential sieving technique. Total glycosaminoglycan and heparan sulfate synthesis was determined by incubating glomeruli in the presence of [35S]sulfate. Characterization of heparan sulfate was performed by ion-exchange chromatography. Systolic blood pressures were significantly lower in enalapril-treated diabetic rats compared to untreated diabetic rats. Diabetic glomeruli synthesized less heparan sulfate than glomeruli from nondiabetic rats. Also, glomerular heparan sulfate content of diabetics was significantly lower than that of nondiabetics. Further characterization of heparan sulfate showed that the fraction eluted with 1 M NaCl was significantly lower and the fraction eluted with 1.25 M NaCl significantly higher in diabetic than in normal rats. Enalapril treatment normalized not only glomerular synthesis and content but also various fractions of heparan sulfate in diabetic rats. Diabetic rats excreted increased quantities of heparan sulfate and albumin than nondiabetic rats. Enalapril therapy prevented both these increases in diabetic rats. These data suggest that enalapril treatment improves albuminuria through preservation of glomerular heparan sulfate and prevention of its urinary loss in diabetic rats."

Cells cultured at 40 degrees C exhibited smaller peaks of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha transcription and protein synthesis compared with cells cultured at 37 degrees C. The addition of dexamethasone before, during, or after exposure of the cells to LPS resulted in temperature-dependent inhibition of IL-1 beta transcription and protein synthesis.

The effects of another antiinflammatory agent, indomethacin, on LPS induction of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA were temperature and cell line dependent.

Similar transcripts were found after stimulation with human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Active secretion of IL-8 was documented by radioimmunoassay in supernatants of mesangial cells activated by either IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha. Using an in vitro migration assay, supernatants from resting mesangial cells were found to be devoid of any chemotactic activity for granulocytes or monocytes. On stimulation with IL-1 beta, however, mesangial cell supernatants expressed MCP-1 biologic activity detected as induction of a strong migratory response for human monocytes but not for granulocytes. In addition, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha induced high levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) mRNAs. Similarly IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha induced the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene and active secretion of its mature protein.

TR heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds efficiently to the thyroid hormone (T(3)) response element (TRE) of target genes. In the absence of T(3), unliganded TR suppresses the basal promoter activity of positively regulated genes (silencing). Silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and nuclear receptor co-repressor (N-CoR) interact with unliganded TR and function as corepressor proteins. Previously, we found beta F451X with carboxyl (C)-terminal 11-amino acid deletion had stronger silencing potency than wild-type TR beta 1 and beta E449X with C-terminal 13-amino acid deletion on a subset of TREs. In the present study, to assess the isoform-specific effects of the C-terminal truncations on TR silencing, we constructed two mutant TR alpha 1s (alpha F397X and alpha E395X) with the same respective C-terminal truncations as beta F451X and beta E449X and analysed their silencing activities. Unlike beta F451X and beta E449X, alpha F397X and alpha E395X showed similarly stronger silencing potency than wild-type TR alpha 1. We further studied the abilities of wild-type and the mutant TR beta 1s and alpha 1s on RXR and co-repressor binding by a two-hybrid interference assay. beta F451X had significantly stronger abilities to bind to RXR and SMRT than did wild-type TR beta 1 and beta E449X. In contrast, wild-type TR alpha 1, alpha F397X and alpha E395X showed similar abilities to bind to RXR and SMRT. beta E449X and alpha E395X, which have identical C-terminal truncation, showed less ability to bind to N-CoR than did wild-type TR beta 1 and beta F451X and wild-type TR alpha 1 and alpha F397X respectively. These results indicate that an identical C-terminal truncation gives rise to different effects on TR beta 1 and alpha1 with respect to silencing potency, RXR binding and SMRT binding. The difference in the silencing potency among wild-type TR beta 1, beta F451X and beta E449X correlated well with the difference in the ability to bind co-repressor SMRT."

The yields of soluble alpha chains in bacteria were comparable to those of recombinant non-alpha chains expressed under the same conditions. Molecular mass and gel-filtration properties of purified recombinant alpha chains were the same as those of authentic human alpha chains. Biochemical and biophysical properties of isolated alpha chains were identical to those of native human alpha chains as assessed by UV/vis, circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy which contrasts with previous results of refolded precipitated alpha chains made in the presence of heme in vitro (M. T. Sanna et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3478-3486, 1997). Mixtures of purified, soluble recombinant alpha-globin and native beta-globin chains formed heterotetramers in vitro, and oxygen- and CO-binding properties as well as the heme environment of the assembled tetramers were experimentally indistinguishable from those of native human Hb A. UV/vis, CD, and NMR spectra of assembled Hb A were also the same as those of human Hb A. These results indicate that individual expressed alpha chains are stable in bacteria and fold properly in vivo and that they then can assemble with free beta chains to form hemoglobin heterotetramers in vivo as well as in vitro."

Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of CT and LT molecules can inhibit TNF-alpha release by macrophages. The results obtained in this study showed that CT and LT are both, in a dose dependent manner, able either to induce or inhibit TNF-alpha release by murine macrophages and primary human monocytes. The results also showed that recombinant B subunits of CT and LT in the absence of their A subunit induce high levels of TNF-alpha release by macrophages and, in addition, increase the level of TNF-alpha release induced by LPS. The ability of both B subunits (CTB and LTB) in inducing TNF-alpha release by macrophages is not related to the level of LPS contamination, since direct measurements of LPS made in the samples employed in this study showed only traces of LPS (3.4 x 10(-8) EU/ml) which is in our system does not induce TNF-alpha release by macrophages. In contrast to the results obtained with the B subunits, incubation of cells with the A subunit of CT (CTA) inhibit TNF-alpha release induced by native CT, native LT, recombinant LTB and LPS. This inhibitory effect must be related to the activity of the A subunit since viability tests performed in terms of metabolic rate demonstrated that high concentrations of CTA are not toxic to the cells. The data presented herein demonstrate that the A subunits of CT and LT have an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha release in macrophages, whereas their B subunits have a stimulatory effect on TNF-alpha. The results also suggest that the dose dependent bi-modal effect of native CT and native LT on TNF-alpha release by macrophages is a result of the combined effect of their individual A and B subunits."

Recovery of the human Ca(v)2.3 subunit was also modulated by beta subunits, but was slowed instead. beta(3) was the most potent subunit tested, followed by beta(4), then beta(2a), which had virtually no effect.

Both during foetal development and in adult epidermis, alpha 2 and alpha 3 were strongly expressed on the cell membrane BK, while alpha 6 was mainly expressed at their dermal pole.

Moreover, with immunoelectron microscopy, LC were seen to be weakly alpha 5 and alpha 6 positive and melanocytes were alpha 3 and alpha 6 positive.

The unique characteristics of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs have been examined with pharmacological, immunostaining, and electrophysiological techniques; however, little is known about their biochemical properties. The aim of this study was to modify existing purification and enrichment techniques to isolate alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs preferentially from the mouse hippocampus and to identify the alpha 5 subunit by using tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The results showed that the detergent solubility of the alpha 5 subunits was distinct from that of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, and the relative distribution of the alpha 5 subunits in Triton X-100-soluble fractions was correlated with that of the extracellular protein radixin but not with that of the postsynaptic protein gephyrin. Mass spectrometry identified the alpha 5 subunit and showed that this subunit associates with multiple alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, but most frequently the beta 3 subunit. Thus, the alpha 5 subunits coassemble with similar subunits as their synaptic counterparts yet have a distinct detergent solubility profile. Mass spectroscopy now offers a method for detecting and characterizing factors that confer the unique detergent solubility and possibly cellular location of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs in hippocampal neurons."

In the present study, we purified the 21 kDa form of alpha-subunit as well as the 23 and 19 kDa forms of beta-subunit from fresh normal first trimester placental tissues by gel filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Purified subunits were hydrolyzed (with a decrease in their molecular weighs) by endoglycosidase H and alpha-mannosidase but not by sialidase or sialidase followed by O-glycanase, indicating that those forms have presumably only high-mannose-type N-linked sugar chains but not O-linked sugar chains of the type present in mature beta-subunit. Fifteen cycles of Edman degradation of the purified forms of the subunits were performed. Only one phenylthiohydantoin amino acid, which was the same amino acid as in the urinary beta-subunit, was detected at each step for the mixture of 23 and 19 kDa forms of beta-subunit, indicating that the protein backbones of both forms are identical to each other as well as to the urinary beta-subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta. Spectroscopic data were consistent with this assumption. The present study proves that the hydrogen bond between Tyr-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta plays a key role in stabilizing the deoxy T structure and consequently in co-operative oxygen binding."

This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-.

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

TGF-beta had no stimulatory effect on either class of [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycans which appeared in an approximately 1:1 and 2:1 ratio of heparan sulfate to dermatan sulfate of the medium and cell layers, respectively, of arterial endothelial cells. Human adult arterial endothelial cells synthesized little or no chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Pulsechase labeling revealed that the appearance of smooth muscle cell proteoglycans into the medium over a 36-h period equaled the disappearance of labeled proteoglycans from the cell layer, independent of TGF-beta. Inhibitors of RNA synthesis blocked TGF-beta-stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in the smooth muscle cells. The incorporation of [35S]methionine into chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core proteins was stimulated by TGF-beta. Taken together, the results presented indicate that TGF-beta stimulates chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan synthesis in human adult arterial smooth muscle cells by promoting the core protein synthesis."

We describe the evolution of the allostery concept, from a conformational change in a two-state model (1965, 1966) to dynamic allostery in the ensemble model (1999); from multi-subunit (1965) proteins to all proteins (2004). We highlight the current available methods to study allostery and their applications in studies of conformational mechanisms, disease, and allosteric drug discovery. We outline the challenges and future directions that we foresee. Altogether, this Editorial narrates the history of this fundamental concept in the life sciences, its significance, methodologies to detect and predict it, and its application in a broad range of living systems.

Like most of the natural Asp-99 beta mutants, Hb Phe-42 alpha showed a markedly increased oxygen affinity, a reduced Bohr effect and diminished co-operativity. Structural probes such as ultraviolet-region derivative and oxy-minus-deoxy difference spectra, resonance Raman scattering and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that, in Hb Phe-42 alpha, the deoxy T quaternary structure is highly destabilized and the strain imposed on the Fe-N epsilon (proximal His) bond is released, stabilizing the oxy tertiary structure. In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of CT and LT molecules can inhibit TNF-alpha release by macrophages. The results obtained in this study showed that CT and LT are both, in a dose dependent manner, able either to induce or inhibit TNF-alpha release by murine macrophages and primary human monocytes. The results also showed that recombinant B subunits of CT and LT in the absence of their A subunit induce high levels of TNF-alpha release by macrophages and, in addition, increase the level of TNF-alpha release induced by LPS. The ability of both B subunits (CTB and LTB) in inducing TNF-alpha release by macrophages is not related to the level of LPS contamination, since direct measurements of LPS made in the samples employed in this study showed only traces of LPS (3.4 x 10(-8) EU/ml) which is in our system does not induce TNF-alpha release by macrophages. In contrast to the results obtained with the B subunits, incubation of cells with the A subunit of CT (CTA) inhibit TNF-alpha release induced by native CT, native LT, recombinant LTB and LPS. This inhibitory effect must be related to the activity of the A subunit since viability tests performed in terms of metabolic rate demonstrated that high concentrations of CTA are not toxic to the cells. The data presented herein demonstrate that the A subunits of CT and LT have an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha release in macrophages, whereas their B subunits have a stimulatory effect on TNF-alpha. The results also suggest that the dose dependent bi-modal effect of native CT and native LT on TNF-alpha release by macrophages is a result of the combined effect of their individual A and B subunits."

Deletion of this motif in alpha7 subunits abolished expression of nAChRs at the membrane of Xenopus oocytes. The same effect was observed upon substitution by homologous motifs of other ligand-gated receptors. When residues from Gln4 to Tyr15 were individually mutated to proline, receptor expression strongly decreased or was totally abolished. Equivalent substitutions to alanine were less harmful, suggesting that proline-induced break of the alpha-helix is responsible for the low expression. Steady-state levels of wild-type and mutant subunits were similar but the formation of pentameric receptors was impaired in the latter. In addition, those mutants that reached the membrane showed a slightly increased internalization rate. Expression of alpha7 nAChRs in neuroblastoma cells confirmed that mutant subunits, although stable, were unable to reach the cell membrane. Analogous mutations in heteromeric nAChRs (alpha3beta4 and alpha4beta2) and 5-HT(3A) receptors also abolished their expression at the membrane. We conclude that the N-terminal alpha-helix of nAChRs is an important requirement for receptor assembly and, therefore, for membrane expression."

The unique characteristics of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs have been examined with pharmacological, immunostaining, and electrophysiological techniques; however, little is known about their biochemical properties. The aim of this study was to modify existing purification and enrichment techniques to isolate alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs preferentially from the mouse hippocampus and to identify the alpha 5 subunit by using tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The results showed that the detergent solubility of the alpha 5 subunits was distinct from that of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, and the relative distribution of the alpha 5 subunits in Triton X-100-soluble fractions was correlated with that of the extracellular protein radixin but not with that of the postsynaptic protein gephyrin. Mass spectrometry identified the alpha 5 subunit and showed that this subunit associates with multiple alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, but most frequently the beta 3 subunit. Thus, the alpha 5 subunits coassemble with similar subunits as their synaptic counterparts yet have a distinct detergent solubility profile.

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

In contrast with Hb Phe-42 alpha, Hb His-42 alpha showed an intermediately impaired function and only moderate destabilization of the T-state, which can be explained by the formation of a new, weak hydrogen bond between His-42 alpha and Asp-99 beta.

Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule."

Studies using (31)-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS) have shown that phosphocreatine (PCr) and muscle pH (pHi) are significantly decreased in patients with COPD during mild exercise, suggesting the early activation of anaerobic glycolysis in their muscles. Thus, muscle oxygenation states during exercise might differ between patients with COPD and healthy individuals. We simultaneously measured oxygenation state and pHi in the muscles of patients with COPD during the transition from rest to exercise (on-transition) using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and (31)P-MRS. Sixteen patients with COPD (aged 68.6 +/- 7.5 years) and 7 healthy males (controls; aged 63.3 +/- 7.5 years) performed dynamic handgrip exercise (lifting a weight by gripping at a rate of 20 grips per min for 3 min). Patients were classified based on pHi data at the completion of exercise as having a normal (>or= 6.9; n = 8) or a low (< 6.9; n = 8) pHi. The deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (deoxy-Hb/Mb) in NIRS recordings remained constant or slightly decreased initially (time delay), then increased to reach a plateau. We calculated the time delay and the time constant of deoxy-Hb/Mb kinetics during the on-transition. The time delay was shorter in the group with a low pHi than in the controls. These findings might reflect a slower increase in O(2) delivery in patients with a low pHi, which might partly account for altered muscle energy metabolism."

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of PL-irradiation on muscle fatigue recovery and physiological response in the upper limbs after maximal repeated rhythmic hand gripping (RRH). Ten males and ten females participated in this study. Subjects performed RRH for 9 min, and then rested for 20 min with PL- or placebo-irradiations. After rest, they again performed RRH for 3 min. As evaluation parameters, we selected the sustained force curve during RRH, subjective muscle-fatigue sensation (Fs), blood lactate concentration (La), muscle oxygenation (Total Hb, Oxy-Hb, and Deoxy-Hb), and skin temperature. The decreasing rate of the integrated area for 30 sec during RRH was significantly smaller in the PL-irradiation than with the placebo. There were no significant differences between irradiation conditions for fatigue sensation and lactate concentration skin temperature during rest was kept high by PL-irradiation. Muscle oxygenation tended to remain slightly high during the initial phase (1-8 min after the exercise). It is inferred that PL-irradiation maintains a high skin temperature and blood flow, but it may not contribute to recover muscle contraction performance in muscle fatigue."

Here, we address the issue of how to generally apply the proposed adaptive filtering method. A total of 156 evoked visual response measurements, collected from 15 individuals, were analyzed. The similarity (correlation) between measurements with far and near source-detector separations collected during the rest period before visual stimulation was used as indicator of global interference dominance. A detailed analysis of CNR improvement in oxy-hemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb), as a function of the rest period correlation coefficient, is presented. Results show that for O(2)Hb measurements, 66% exhibited substantial global interference. For this dataset, dominated by global interference, 71% of the measurements revealed CNR improvements after adaptive filtering, with a mean CNR improvement of 60%. No CNR improvement was observed for HHb. This study corroborates our previous finding that adaptive filtering provides an effective method to increase CNR when there is strong global interference, and also provides a practical way for determining when and where to apply this technique."

The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding.

Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine.

Hemoglobinopathies caused by highly unstable beta-chain variants have a dominant thalassemia-like phenotype, in which carriers have a clinical expression of thalassemia intermedia, but highly unstable alpha-globin variants are usually only phenotypically apparent when they interact with other alpha-thalassemia mutations. In a child with clinical and hematological features consistent with beta-thalassemia intermedia, DNA analysis excluded any beta-globin gene mutations but characterized a novel deletion cd37(C2)Pro>0 (Hb Heraklion) in the alpha1 globin gene, in trans to a common Mediterranean nondeletion alpha-thalassemia mutation (alpha(Hph)alpha). The deletion of proline at alpha37(C2) is predicted to result in severe instability of the variant hemoglobin, which on interaction with a synthesis-deficient alpha-thalassemia mutation causes a relatively severe dyserythropoietic anemia, representing an alternative phenotype associated with highly unstable alpha-chain variants.

            "article": "The general assumption among researchers on hemoglobin is that the intramolecular central cavity cross-bridging of Hb does not result in any generalized perturbations at the protein surface. A corollary of this is that central cavity cross-bridges are unlikely to influence the polymerization of deoxy HbS, since polymerization is a protein surface phenomenon involving the participation of multiple protein surface amino acid residues. In an attempt to evaluate this experimentally, we have introduced two low-O2-affinity-inducing central cavity cross-bridges into HbS, beta(beta)-sebacyl [between the two Lys-82(beta) residues] and alpha(alpha)-fumaryl [between the two Lys-99(alpha) residues], and investigated their influence on the polymerization of the deoxy protein. The O2 affinities of the cross-bridged HbS exhibited sensitivity toward the buffer ions and pH in a cross-link-specific fashion. The modulation of the O2 affinity of these cross-bridged HbS in the presence of allosteric effectors, DPG and L-35, is also very distinct, reflecting the differences in the conformational features these two cross-bridges induce within the central cavity at the respective effector-binding domains. In addition, the alpha(alpha)-fumaryl cross bridge inhibited the polymerization, reflecting the perturbation of the microenvironment of one or more intermolecular contact residues, protein surface residues, as a consequence of the central cavity cross-bridge. On the other hand, the beta(beta)-sebacyl cross-bridge exerted a slight potentiating effect on the polymerization of HbS. This reflects the fact that the perturbations at the protein surface are limited and favor polymerization. The results presented demonstrate that the structural changes induced by the central cavity cross-bridges are very specific and not simply restricted to the sites of modification, but are propagated to distant sites/domains, both within and outside the central cavity. It is conceivable that other surface regions that are not involved in the polymerization could also experience similar structural/conformational consequences. These results should be taken into consideration in designing intramolecularly cross-bridged asymmetric hybrid HbS for mapping the contribution of the intermolecular contact residues in the cis and trans dimers of deoxy HbS during polymerization."

Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) is very well obeyed in the native protein, but not around the site of the changed residue in the mutant. NCS is also not obeyed by the water molecule invariably found in the alpha-chain haem pocket in room-temperature crystal structures of haemoglobin. At 120 K, this water molecule disappears from one alpha chain in the asymmetric unit but not the other."

It was clarified from the UVRR bands at 1605 and 1166 cm(-)(1) characteristic of tyrosinate that the tyrosine (F8) of the abnormal subunit in Hb M Iwate adopts a deprotonated form. UV Raman bands of other Tyr residues indicated that the protein takes the T-quaternary structure even in the met form. Although both hemes of alpha and beta subunits in metHb A take a six-coordinate (6c) high-spin structure, the 406.7-nm excited RR spectrum of metHb M Iwate indicated that the abnormal alpha subunit adopts a 5c high-spin structure. The present results and our previous observation of the nu(Fe)(-)(O(tyrosine)) Raman band [Nagai et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 2418-2422] have proved that F8-tyrosinate is covalently bound to Fe(III) heme in the alpha subunit of Hb M Iwate. As a result, peripheral groups of porphyrin ring, especially the vinyl and the propionate side chains, were so strongly influenced that the RR spectrum in the low-frequency region excited at 406.7 nm is distinctly changed from the normal pattern. When Hb M Iwate was fully reduced, the characteristic UVRR bands of tyrosinate disappeared and the Raman bands of tyrosine at 1620 (Y8a), 1207 (Y7a), and 1177 cm(-)(1) (Y9a) increased in intensity. Coordination of distal His(E7) to the Fe(II) heme in the reduced alpha subunit of Hb M Iwate was proved by the observation of the nu(Fe)(-)(His) RR band in the 441.6-nm excited RR spectrum at the same frequency as that of its isolated alpha chain. The effects of the distal-His coordination on the heme appeared as a distortion of the peripheral groups of heme. A possible mechanism for the formation of a Fe(III)-tyrosinate bond in Hb M Iwate is discussed."

However, the phenotypic expression of hyperunstable hemoglobin variants often includes features of thalassemia, along with variable peripheral hemolysis. Hemoglobinopathies caused by highly unstable beta-chain variants have a dominant thalassemia-like phenotype, in which carriers have a clinical expression of thalassemia intermedia, but highly unstable alpha-globin variants are usually only phenotypically apparent when they interact with other alpha-thalassemia mutations. In a child with clinical and hematological features consistent with beta-thalassemia intermedia, DNA analysis excluded any beta-globin gene mutations but characterized a novel deletion cd37(C2)Pro>0 (Hb Heraklion) in the alpha1 globin gene, in trans to a common Mediterranean nondeletion alpha-thalassemia mutation (alpha(Hph)alpha). The deletion of proline at alpha37(C2) is predicted to result in severe instability of the variant hemoglobin, which on interaction with a synthesis-deficient alpha-thalassemia mutation causes a relatively severe dyserythropoietic anemia, representing an alternative phenotype associated with highly unstable alpha-chain variants. Hb Heraklion is the fourth highly unstable alpha-globin variant that we have observed in patients from Greece and Albania.

However, TGF-beta consistently stimulated the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Both chondroitin 4- and chondroitin 6-sulfate were stimulated by TGF-beta to the same extent. TGF-beta had no stimulatory effect on either class of [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycans which appeared in an approximately 1:1 and 2:1 ratio of heparan sulfate to dermatan sulfate of the medium and cell layers, respectively, of arterial endothelial cells. Human adult arterial endothelial cells synthesized little or no chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Pulsechase labeling revealed that the appearance of smooth muscle cell proteoglycans into the medium over a 36-h period equaled the disappearance of labeled proteoglycans from the cell layer, independent of TGF-beta. Inhibitors of RNA synthesis blocked TGF-beta-stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in the smooth muscle cells. The incorporation of [35S]methionine into chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core proteins was stimulated by TGF-beta. Taken together, the results presented indicate that TGF-beta stimulates chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan synthesis in human adult arterial smooth muscle cells by promoting the core protein synthesis."

Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule."

A cytosolic kinase activity remaining after Ca(2+)-induced translocation of beta-PKC was dependent on PS and DG but did not require Ca2+. This novel Ca(2+)-independent, PS/DG-dependent kinase, termed nPKC, eluted from hydroxyapatite between alpha-PKC and beta-PKC, ran as a 76-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and was reactive to a polyclonal consensus antibody but not to monoclonal antibodies to alpha-PKC, beta-PKC, or gamma-PKC. Long chain fatty acyl-CoA, but not the corresponding free fatty acids, inhibited nPKC in the 1-10 microM range.

Purified beta-PKC phosphorylated a number of cytosolic proteins in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, including a major 47-kDa cytosolic protein, which may be implicated in superoxide anion generation. In contrast, nPKC did not phosphorylate the 47-kDa protein, but phosphorylated numerous cytosolic proteins in a Ca(2+)-independent manner, including a 66-kDa protein which was not phosphorylated by beta-PKC.

The unique characteristics of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs have been examined with pharmacological, immunostaining, and electrophysiological techniques; however, little is known about their biochemical properties. The aim of this study was to modify existing purification and enrichment techniques to isolate alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs preferentially from the mouse hippocampus and to identify the alpha 5 subunit by using tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The results showed that the detergent solubility of the alpha 5 subunits was distinct from that of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, and the relative distribution of the alpha 5 subunits in Triton X-100-soluble fractions was correlated with that of the extracellular protein radixin but not with that of the postsynaptic protein gephyrin. Mass spectrometry identified the alpha 5 subunit and showed that this subunit associates with multiple alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, but most frequently the beta 3 subunit. Thus, the alpha 5 subunits coassemble with similar subunits as their synaptic counterparts yet have a distinct detergent solubility profile. Mass spectroscopy now offers a method for detecting and characterizing factors that confer the unique detergent solubility and possibly cellular location of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs in hippocampal neurons."

Previous studies have demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of CT and LT molecules can inhibit TNF-alpha release by macrophages. The results obtained in this study showed that CT and LT are both, in a dose dependent manner, able either to induce or inhibit TNF-alpha release by murine macrophages and primary human monocytes. The results also showed that recombinant B subunits of CT and LT in the absence of their A subunit induce high levels of TNF-alpha release by macrophages and, in addition, increase the level of TNF-alpha release induced by LPS. The ability of both B subunits (CTB and LTB) in inducing TNF-alpha release by macrophages is not related to the level of LPS contamination, since direct measurements of LPS made in the samples employed in this study showed only traces of LPS (3.4 x 10(-8) EU/ml) which is in our system does not induce TNF-alpha release by macrophages. In contrast to the results obtained with the B subunits, incubation of cells with the A subunit of CT (CTA) inhibit TNF-alpha release induced by native CT, native LT, recombinant LTB and LPS. This inhibitory effect must be related to the activity of the A subunit since viability tests performed in terms of metabolic rate demonstrated that high concentrations of CTA are not toxic to the cells. The data presented herein demonstrate that the A subunits of CT and LT have an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha release in macrophages, whereas their B subunits have a stimulatory effect on TNF-alpha. The results also suggest that the dose dependent bi-modal effect of native CT and native LT on TNF-alpha release by macrophages is a result of the combined effect of their individual A and B subunits."

These receptors mediate cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesive properties for a variety of cell types. This investigation has focused on the histologic distribution of the beta 1 subfamily of integrins within lymphoid tissues including tonsil, lymph node, spleen, thymus, and appendix. The dendritic cells of both follicular center and thymic origin express the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6, as well as the beta 1 integrin subunits. Most lymphoid cells in normal tissues do not express the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 subunits, or the alpha v beta 3 integrin. The beta 1 subunit is expressed by all lymphocytes but with variable intensity. Increased levels of the alpha 5 and beta 1 subunits are observed in the follicular light zone, suggesting a role for these integrins in B-cell activation. Although the alpha 4 subunit is expressed by all lymphoid cells, an increased expression of alpha 4 and decreased expression of beta 1 by the mantle zone B-cell compartment is noted in comparison with the decreased expression of alpha 4 and increased expression of beta 1 by follicular center B-cells. These studies suggest that alpha 4 may be paired with a beta subunit other than beta 1 on the mantle zone lymphoid population. Thus, integrin expression by cells of lymphoid tissues varies with location and function and differs significantly from integrin expression observed on circulating and cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes."

Unlike conventional postsynaptic receptors, GABA(A)Rs containing the alpha 5 subunit (alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs) are localized primarily to extrasynaptic regions of neurons, where they generate a tonic inhibitory conductance. The unique characteristics of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs have been examined with pharmacological, immunostaining, and electrophysiological techniques; however, little is known about their biochemical properties. The aim of this study was to modify existing purification and enrichment techniques to isolate alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs preferentially from the mouse hippocampus and to identify the alpha 5 subunit by using tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The results showed that the detergent solubility of the alpha 5 subunits was distinct from that of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, and the relative distribution of the alpha 5 subunits in Triton X-100-soluble fractions was correlated with that of the extracellular protein radixin but not with that of the postsynaptic protein gephyrin. Mass spectrometry identified the alpha 5 subunit and showed that this subunit associates with multiple alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, but most frequently the beta 3 subunit. Thus, the alpha 5 subunits coassemble with similar subunits as their synaptic counterparts yet have a distinct detergent solubility profile. Mass spectroscopy now offers a method for detecting and characterizing factors that confer the unique detergent solubility and possibly cellular location of alpha 5 GABA(A)Rs in hippocampal neurons."

Importantly, accessibility of TCR beta chains in MB-pre-TCR complexes is restored by filling in the 'missing' variable (V) domain of pT alpha with a V domain from TCR alpha. Moreover, the proportion of pre-TCR complexes in which the TCR beta subunits are accessible to anti-TCR beta antibody varies with the cellular context, suggesting that TCR beta accessibility is controlled by a trans-acting factor.

Co-injection with wild-type and mutant subunits led to the appearance of receptors with wild-type, mutant and hybrid conductances.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria.

The substances in the gas phase but not in the tar phase can pass through the airway epithelial barrier, enter the systemic circulation via the pulmonary circulation, and increase systemic oxidative damage, leading to the development of cigarette smoking-related diseases such as atherosclerosis. Recently, we identified some stable carbonyl compounds, including acrolein (ACR) and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), as major cytotoxic factors in nicotine- and tar-free cigarette smoke extract (CSE) of the gas phase. CSE, ACR, and MVK induce protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent activation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) and subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NOX, causing plasma membrane damage and cell apoptosis. CSE, ACR, and MVK also trigger carbonylation of PKC, which is an irreversible oxidative modification. Cell damage and PKC carbonylation in response to treatment with CSE, ACR, or MVK are abolished by thiol-containing antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine and reduced glutathione. Thus pharmacological modulation of PKC and NOX activities and the trapping of ROS are potential strategies for the prevention of diseases related to cigarette smoking. "

Increased production of oil and natural gas, particularly from shale resources using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, made the United States the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas in 2014. This review examines air quality impacts, specifically, changes in greenhouse gas, criteria air pollutant, and air toxics emissions from oil and gas production activities that are a result of these changes in energy supplies and use. National emission inventories indicate that volatile organic compound (VOC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from oil and gas supply chains in the United States have been increasing significantly, whereas emission inventories for greenhouse gases have seen slight declines over the past decade. These emission inventories are based on counts of equipment and operational activities (activity factors), multiplied by average emission factors, and therefore are subject to uncertainties in these factors. Although uncertainties associated with activity data and missing emission source types can be significant, multiple recent measurement studies indicate that the greatest uncertainties are associated with emission factors. In many source categories, small groups of devices or sites, referred to as super-emitters, contribute a large fraction of emissions. When super-emitters are accounted for, multiple measurement approaches, at multiple scales, produce similar results for estimated emissions. Challenges moving forward include identifying super-emitters and reducing their emission magnitudes. Work done to date suggests that both equipment malfunction and operational practices can be important. Finally, although most of this review focuses on emissions from energy supply infrastructures, the regional air quality implications of some coupled energy production and use scenarios are examined. These case studies suggest that both energy production and use should be considered in assessing air quality implications of changes in energy infrastructures, and that impacts are likely to vary among regions."

In vehicle and cyclosporine groups, the gene expression of the neuronal, inducible, and endothelial nitric oxide synthases in cerebellum, heart, intestine, liver, renal cortex, and medulla was evaluated. The administration of cyclosporine was associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in renal cortex and liver, and a decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in renal medulla. The mRNA levels of the 3 nitric oxide synthase isoforms were not affected in any other tissue. Nifedipine did not alter nitric oxide synthase expression in the control group but prevented changes associated with cyclosporine. These results suggest that cyclosporine-induced changes in the pattern of expression of the nitric oxide synthases may be secondary to its hemodynamic effects."

Together with biogenic amines and cytokines, production of NO in invertebrate phagocytic haemocytes is thought to represent a putative stress response. In this study the hypothesis that NO might be a sensitive biomarker of stress in invertebrates has been tested. The spectrophotometric Griess assay for nitrite and nitrate has been modified so that the final breakdown products of NO are suitable for measurement in invertebrate haemolymph. The assay was linear in the range 1-100 microM with a sensitivity of 4 microM. The baseline NOx measurement in unstressed mussels was 0.74 mM NOx/mg protein. Mytilus edulis were kept at 15 micro C in filtered seawater for at least 2 days prior to exposure to TBTO (0.001-0.1 mg/l) for 24 h. Preliminary results suggest that TBTO perturbs the NO response and that the outlined assay protocol is a sensitive means of detecting those changes. It is proposed that NO measurements potentially offer a highly sensitive, non-invasive means of monitoring stress responses associated with environmental change."

Previous studies have reported conflicting results for the roles of nitric oxide in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a major center that regulates sympathetic and cardiovascular activities. We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure. Microinjection of a high dose (100 nmol) of sodium nitroprusside decreased arterial pressure and inhibited spontaneous respiration with concomitant production of peroxynitrite, a strong cytotoxic oxidant. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of L-glutamate were inhibited after preinjection of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol) were inhibited after preinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. They also indicate that nitric oxide may stimulate neurons both through activation of the nitric oxide cyclic GMP pathway and through modulation of glutamate receptor stimulation, and therefore, increase arterial pressure in rats."

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Measurements of the Kd for 3-phosphoglycerate from the NMR experiments show that the mutant enzyme has a 30-times reduced affinity for this substrate as compared with the wild-type enzyme.

The first complex contains a peptide representing the Hrb C-terminal NPFL motif; the second contains a peptide in which an Arg residue substitutes the C-terminal Leu. The NPF residues are almost completely embedded in a hydrophobic pocket on the EH domain surface and the backbone of NPFX adopts a conformation reminiscent of the Asx-Pro type I beta-turn motif.

Using the human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, and 14 different compounds (4 nonsteroidal antiestrogens, 6 oxysterols with appreciable binding affinities for the antiestrogen-binding site, and 4 other sterols with little or no affinity for this site), we showed that for compounds which bound to the antiestrogen-binding site, there was a clear positive correlation between their relative cytotoxic potencies and their affinities for this binding site. Two sterols, namely 25-hydroxycholesterol and 20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, were exceptions to this general pattern, both clearly inhibited cell proliferation without having significant binding affinity for the antiestrogen-binding site. The same general order of antiproliferative potency of the oxysterols seen with MCF7 cells was also observed with the murine lymphoma cell line EL4.

Both serum and brain concentrations of ZNS tended to increase as the dose of VPA or PHT was increased. While coadministrations of ZNS (75 mg/kg) and VPA or PHT at any dose did not change brain and serum NOx levels, those altered brain monoamine contents. These results suggested that anticonvulsive effect of coadministrations of ZNS and VPA or PHT were caused by changes of monoamines rather than changes of NO metabolites."

Bacillus pasteurii cytochrome c(553), characterized by a low reduction potential and by a low sequence homology with cytochromes from Gram-negative bacteria or eukaryotes, is a useful case study for understanding the structure-function relationships for this class of electron-transfer proteins. Diffraction data on a single crystal of cytochrome c(553) were obtained using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The structure was determined at 0.97-A resolution using ab initio phasing and independently at 1.70 A in an MAD experiment. In both experiments, the structure solution exploited the presence of a single Fe atom as anomalous scatterer in the protein. For the 0.97-A data, the phasing was based on a single data set. This is the most precise structure of a heme protein to date. The crystallized cytochrome c(553) contains only 71 of the 92 residues expected from the intact protein sequence, lacking the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. This feature is consistent with previous evidence that this tail, responsible for anchoring the protein to the cytoplasm membrane, is easily cleaved off during the purification procedure. The heme prosthetic group in B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is surrounded by three alpha-helices in a compact arrangement. The largely exposed c-type heme group features a His-Met axial coordination of the Fe(III) ion. The protein is characterized by a very asymmetric charge distribution, with the exposed heme edge located on a surface patch devoid of net charges. A structural search of a representative set of protein structures reveals that B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is most similar to Pseudomonas cytochromes c(551), followed by cytochromes c(6), Desulfovibrio cytochrome c(553), cytochromes c(552) from thermophiles, and cytochromes c from eukaryotes. Notwithstanding a low sequence homology, a structure-based alignment of these cytochromes shows conservation of three helical regions, with different additional secondary structure motifs characterizing each protein. In B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553), these motifs are represented by the shortest interhelix connecting fragments observed for this group of proteins. The possible relationships between heme solvent accessibility and the electrochemical reduction potential are discussed."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130.

The cell death induced by rVvhA was independent of lysosomal permeabilizaton and caspase activation. rVvhA induced rapid phosphorylation of c-Src in the membrane lipid raft, which resulted in an increased interaction between lipid raft molecule caveolin-1 and NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex Rac1 for ROS production.

Understanding such interactions is important as monotopic enzymes frequently act on hydrophobic substrates, while X-ray structures rarely provide direct information about their interactions with membranes. CG-MD self-assembly simulations enable prediction of the orientation and depth of insertion into a lipid bilayer of a monotopic protein, and also of the interactions of individual protein residues with lipid molecules. The CG-MD method has been evaluated via comparison with extended (>30 ns) atomistic simulations of monoamine oxidase, revealing good agreement between the results of coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. CG-MD simulations have been applied to a set of 11 monotopic proteins for which three-dimensional structures are available. These proteins may be divided into two groups on the basis of the results of the simulations. One group consists of those proteins which are inserted into the lipid bilayer to a limited extent, interacting mainly at the phospholipid-water interface. The second group consists of those which are inserted more deeply into the bilayer. Those monotopic proteins which are inserted more deeply cause significant local perturbation of bilayer properties such as bilayer thickness. Deeper insertion seems to correlate with a greater number of basic residues in the \"foot\" whereby a monotopic protein interacts with the membrane."

A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data.

The cytotoxicity and hydrophobicity of heme necessitates that heme mobilization is carefully controlled at the cellular and systemic level. However, the molecules and mechanisms that mediate heme homeostasis are poorly understood. In this Account, we provide a heuristic paradigm with which to conceptualize heme trafficking and highlight the most recent developments in the mechanisms underlying heme trafficking. As an iron-containing tetrapyrrole, heme exhibits properties of both transition metals and lipids. Accordingly, we propose its transport and trafficking will reflect principles gleaned from the trafficking of both metals and lipids. Using this conceptual framework, we follow the flow of heme from the final step of heme synthesis in the mitochondria to hemoproteins present in various subcellular organelles. Further, given that many cells and animals that cannot make heme can assimilate it intact from nutritional sources, we propose that intercellular heme trafficking pathways must exist. This necessitates that heme be able to be imported and exported from cells, escorted between cells and organs, and regulated at the organismal level via a coordinated systemic process.

However, the properties of LH pools, including concentration, oxidation state, distribution, speciation, and dynamics, are poorly understood. Herein, we elucidate the nature and dynamics of LH using genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae We find that the subcellular distribution of LH is heterogeneous; the cytosol maintains LH at \u223c20-40 nM, whereas the mitochondria and nucleus maintain it at concentrations below 2.5 nM. Further, we find that the signaling molecule nitric oxide can initiate the rapid mobilization of heme in the cytosol and nucleus from certain thiol-containing factors. We also find that the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase constitutes a major cellular heme buffer, and is responsible for maintaining the activity of the heme-dependent nuclear transcription factor heme activator protein (Hap1p). Altogether, we demonstrate that the heme sensors can be used to reveal fundamental aspects of heme trafficking and dynamics and can be used across multiple organisms, including Escherichia coli, yeast, and human cell lines."

We mutated a target residue in that site (Ser-1412 to Asp) to mimic phosphorylation and then characterized the mutant using conventional and stopped-flow spectroscopies. Compared with wild-type, S1412D nNOS catalyzed faster cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction but displayed slower steady-state NO synthesis with greater uncoupling of NADPH oxidation. Paradoxically, the mutant had faster heme reduction, faster heme-NO complex formation, and greater heme-NO complex accumulation at steady state. To understand how these behaviors related to flavin and heme reduction rates, we utilized three soybean calmodulins (CaMs) that supported a range of slower flavin and heme reduction rates in mutant and wild-type nNOS. Reductase activity and two catalytic parameters (speed and amount of heme-NO complex formation) related directly to the speed of flavin and heme reduction. In contrast, steady-state NO synthesis increased, reached a plateau, and then fell at the highest rate of heme reduction that was obtained with S1412D nNOS + CaM. Substituting with soybean CaM slowed heme reduction and increased steady-state NO synthesis by the mutant. We conclude the following. 1) The S1412D mutation speeds electron transfer out of the reductase domain. 2) Faster heme reduction speeds intrinsic NO synthesis but diminishes NO release in the steady state. 3) Heme reduction displays an optimum regarding NO release during steady state. The unique behavior of S1412D nNOS reveals the importance of heme reduction rate in controlling steady-state activity and suggests that nNOS already has a near-optimal rate of heme reduction."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

Our study was based on previous findings that demonstrated that Br2 upregulates the heme-degrading enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which converts toxic heme into bilverdin. Interestingly, following Br2 inhalation, heme levels were indeed elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and whole lung tissue in C57BL/6 mice. High heme levels correlated with increased lung oxidative stress, lung inflammation, respiratory acidosis, lung edema, higher airway resistance, and mortality. However, therapeutic reduction of heme levels, by either scavenging with hemopexin or degradation by HO-1, improved lung function and survival. Therefore, heme attenuation may prove a useful adjuvant therapy to treat patients after Br2 exposure. "

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria.

We found that rVvhA significantly increased LC3 puncta formation and autophagic flux in promoting the cell death of human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. The cell death induced by rVvhA was independent of lysosomal permeabilizaton and caspase activation. rVvhA induced rapid phosphorylation of c-Src in the membrane lipid raft, which resulted in an increased interaction between lipid raft molecule caveolin-1 and NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex Rac1 for ROS production. NOX-mediated ROS signaling induced by rVvhA increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) which are required for mRNA expression of Atg5 and Atg16L1 involved in autophagosome formation.

The substances in the gas phase but not in the tar phase can pass through the airway epithelial barrier, enter the systemic circulation via the pulmonary circulation, and increase systemic oxidative damage, leading to the development of cigarette smoking-related diseases such as atherosclerosis. Recently, we identified some stable carbonyl compounds, including acrolein (ACR) and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), as major cytotoxic factors in nicotine- and tar-free cigarette smoke extract (CSE) of the gas phase. CSE, ACR, and MVK induce protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent activation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) and subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NOX, causing plasma membrane damage and cell apoptosis. CSE, ACR, and MVK also trigger carbonylation of PKC, which is an irreversible oxidative modification. Cell damage and PKC carbonylation in response to treatment with CSE, ACR, or MVK are abolished by thiol-containing antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine and reduced glutathione. Thus pharmacological modulation of PKC and NOX activities and the trapping of ROS are potential strategies for the prevention of diseases related to cigarette smoking. "

X-ray specular reflectivity measurements showed that the thickness of annexin I layer bound to the phospholipid monolayer was 31 +/- 2 A, indicating that annexin I binds membranes as a protein monomer or monolayer. Surface plasmon resonance measurements of annexin I, V, and mutants, which allowed evaluation of membrane aggregation activity of annexin I separately from its membrane binding, revealed direct correlation between the relative membrane aggregation activity and the relative affinity of the secondary interaction site for the secondary membrane. The secondary binding was driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions, unlike calcium-mediated electrostatic primary membrane binding. Chemical cross-linking of membrane-bound annexin I showed that a significant degree of lateral association of annexin I molecules precedes its membrane aggregation. Taken together, these results support a hypothetical model of annexin I-mediated membrane aggregation, in which a laterally aggregated monolayer of membrane-bound annexin I directly interacts with a secondary membrane via its induced hydrophobic interaction site."

An interesting feature is the asymmetry of compartments and the existence of a diffusion layer adjacent to only one face of the enzymic membrane. In such a situation the apparent enzyme activity and the product distribution in the system have been studied versus all the possibilities of combination of ATP and glycerol supply. Our approach has lead us to differentiate two different roles played by a diffusion layer adjacent to a permeable enzymic membrane. Depending on the spatial origin of the enzymic substrates (i.e. from which compartment they derive), the diffusion layer can play either the role of a passive additional resistance to that of the membrane or the role of a third compartment in which the reaction product can partially accumulate before splitting on both parts of the membrane. Our results mainly demonstrate that a membrane-bound enzyme activity and the resulting product distribution occurring in a compartmentalized system may be regulated by the cumulative effect due to the asymmetry in volumes of the compartments, the presence of a diffusion layer and the different possibilities of substrate supply. With the topography studied, which is close to that reported for many 'in vivo' situations, the product may be diffused lead to vectorial metabolism processes."

About 70% of the phosphodiesterase activity found in rod outer segments is membrane-bound, and is thought to be anchored to the membrane through C-terminal prenyl groups. The recombinant delta subunit has been shown to solubilize the membrane-bound form of the enzyme. This paper describes the site and mechanism of this interaction in more detail. In isolated rod outer segments, the delta subunit was found exclusively in the soluble fraction, and about 30% of it did not coimmunoprecipitate with the catalytic subunits. The delta subunit that was bound to the catalytic subunits dissociated slowly, with a half-life of about 3.5 h. To determine whether the site of this strong binding was the C-termini of the phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits, peptides corresponding to the C-terminal ends of the alpha and beta subunits were synthesized. Micromolar concentrations of these peptides blocked the phosphodiesterase/delta subunit interaction. Interestingly, this blockade only occurred if the peptides were both prenylated and methylated. These results suggested that a major site of interaction of the delta subunit is the methylated, prenylated C-terminus of the phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits. To determine whether the catalytic subunits of the full-length enzyme are methylated in situ when bound to the delta subunit, we labeled rod outer segments with a tritiated methyl donor. Soluble phosphodiesterase from these rod outer segments was more highly methylated (4.5 +/- 0.3-fold) than the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase, suggesting that the delta subunit bound preferentially to the methylated enzyme in the outer segment. Together these results suggest that the delta subunit/phosphodiesterase catalytic subunit interaction may be regulated by the C-terminal methylation of the catalytic subunits."

For this reason, the thickness of zinc oxide film will be investigated and determined in this study. The interaction of nitric oxide with a 20 nm zinc oxide layer on gold leads to the shift of the resonance angle.

We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure.

These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla.

There have now been a number of randomised trials performed exploring the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide.

The sensor also shows negligible humidity interfering effect and high sensor stability, originating from the hydrophobicity and chemical stability of the material, respectively. In contrast, annealing temperatures higher than 400 degrees C lead to structural defects in SWNTs and thus lower the sensing performance. We experimentally confirm that these SWNT characteristics make SWNTs a suitable gas sensing material from a practical perspective."

Development of gas sensor with high sensitivity is very important because the concentration of NO gas in the environment and respiratory tract is extremely low, therefore not readily detectable. The material with nanostructure can improve the sensitivity of sensor owning to surface effect and size effect. Herein, we developed a new type of gaseous nanosensor assembled by 34 nanowires of conducting polymer, PEDOT: PSS. The nanowires were fabricated by dip pen nanolithography (DPN) with the length of 55 um and diameter of 300 nm between golden wires. The NO gas measurement is based on chemiresistor based methods. The result of dynamic measurement of NO gas at 100 ppm shows repeatability and stability; the recovery time is 10.4 minutes. Moreover, the lowest concentration of NO gas in static measurement is 10ppm at 80 C, which also shows the ability sensing at low temperature."

The PANI nanoparticles (PPANI) anchored onto rGO surfaces (PPANI/rGO) and the PANI nanofiber (FPANI) are successfully interconnected and deposited onto flexible PET substrates to form hierarchical nanocomposite (PPANI/rGO-FPANI) network films. The assembled flexible, transparent electronic gas sensor exhibits high sensing performance towards NH3 gas concentrations ranging from 100 ppb to 100 ppm, reliable transparency (90.3% at 550 nm) for the PPANI/rGO-FPANI film (6 h sample), fast response/recovery time (36 s/18 s), and robust flexibility without an obvious performance decrease after 1000 bending/extending cycles. The excellent sensing performance could probably be ascribed to the synergetic effects and the relatively high surface area (47.896 m(2) g(-1)) of the PPANI/rGO-FPANI network films, the efficient artificial neural network sensing channels, and the effectively exposed active surfaces.

Measurements of the Kd for 3-phosphoglycerate from the NMR experiments show that the mutant enzyme has a 30-times reduced affinity for this substrate as compared with the wild-type enzyme.

The first complex contains a peptide representing the Hrb C-terminal NPFL motif; the second contains a peptide in which an Arg residue substitutes the C-terminal Leu. The NPF residues are almost completely embedded in a hydrophobic pocket on the EH domain surface and the backbone of NPFX adopts a conformation reminiscent of the Asx-Pro type I beta-turn motif.

Five amino acids on the EH surface mediate specific recognition of this residue through hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts.

Following up on a recent observation in our laboratory that certain oxysterols bind with high affinity to the microsomal antiestrogen-binding site, we attempted to determine if a relationship existed between the antiproliferative effect of oxysterols and their binding affinities for the antiestrogen-binding site. Using the human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, and 14 different compounds (4 nonsteroidal antiestrogens, 6 oxysterols with appreciable binding affinities for the antiestrogen-binding site, and 4 other sterols with little or no affinity for this site), we showed that for compounds which bound to the antiestrogen-binding site, there was a clear positive correlation between their relative cytotoxic potencies and their affinities for this binding site. Two sterols, namely 25-hydroxycholesterol and 20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, were exceptions to this general pattern, both clearly inhibited cell proliferation without having significant binding affinity for the antiestrogen-binding site. The same general order of antiproliferative potency of the oxysterols seen with MCF7 cells was also observed with the murine lymphoma cell line EL4.

This conjugate is a semisynthetic enzyme having NADH oxidase activity; the ethylphenazine moiety works as a catalytic group, and the coenzyme-binding site of glutamate dehydrogenase works as a substrate-binding site. The effects of the presence of the substrate-binding site near the catalytic group were studied by using EP(+)-PEG-GluDH. Before the preparation of the conjugate, the reactivity of NADH bound in the coenzyme-binding site toward the ethylphenazine moiety was estimated for glutamate and lactate dehydrogenases. The results show that the NADH molecule bound in the site of glutamate dehydrogenase reacts with EP(+)-PEG at a rate of 43% of that of free NADH, but the NADH molecule bound in lactate dehydrogenase does not react with 1-(3-carboxypropyloxy)-5- ethylphenazine. Therefore, glutamate dehydrogenase was used as the substrate-binding site of the semisynthetic NADH oxidase. The results of the kinetic analysis of the activity of EP(+)-PEG-GluDH show that the apparent turnover number of the active site is 0.38 s-1, which corresponds to the apparent intramolecular rate constant of the oxidation of NADH bound in the active site. The apparent effective concentration of bound NADH for the catalytic group of the ethylphenazine moiety is 0.33 mM. This means that the presence of the substrate-binding site near the catalytic group increases the local NADH concentration by at most 0.33 mM, and this is the rate-accelerating effect of the binding site."

A preliminary study of adenosine binding to phosphoglycerate kinase was made in order to be sure of the nature of the adenine site. From the change in chemical shifts of the 'basic patch' histidine resonances (His62, 167 and 170), the nucleotide C8-H, C2-H and C1'-H resonances and resonances 40 and 41 (assigned to Thr373 and Thr375 in the hydrophobic, i.e. catalytic, site), it is apparent that there are at least two ADP binding sites on the enzyme: one at the hydrophobic (catalytic) site and one at the electrostatic site. A comparison of the results for ADP and ATP reveals differences due to the differential binding of the phosphate groups. The presence of Mg2+ results in further differences being observed. The data suggest that the primary binding site of ADP, in the absence of Mg2+, involves electrostatic interactions between the diphosphate chain of the substrate and the 'basic patch' region of the N-terminal domain. In the presence of greater than or equal to 1:1 ratio of Mg2+/ADP, however, the primary binding site involves predominantly hydrophobic interactions between the adenosine moiety and the catalytic site, with secondary binding occurring at the electrostatic site. Addition of Mg2+, therefore, tends to reduce the affinity of the electrostatic site (presumably by competing for ADP). It is suggested that alpha-helix XII, including residues 372, 373 and 375, moves differentially on binding ADP, Mg ADP, ATP or Mg .

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

The structure was determined at 0.97-A resolution using ab initio phasing and independently at 1.70 A in an MAD experiment. In both experiments, the structure solution exploited the presence of a single Fe atom as anomalous scatterer in the protein. For the 0.97-A data, the phasing was based on a single data set. This is the most precise structure of a heme protein to date. The crystallized cytochrome c(553) contains only 71 of the 92 residues expected from the intact protein sequence, lacking the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. This feature is consistent with previous evidence that this tail, responsible for anchoring the protein to the cytoplasm membrane, is easily cleaved off during the purification procedure. The heme prosthetic group in B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is surrounded by three alpha-helices in a compact arrangement. The largely exposed c-type heme group features a His-Met axial coordination of the Fe(III) ion. The protein is characterized by a very asymmetric charge distribution, with the exposed heme edge located on a surface patch devoid of net charges. A structural search of a representative set of protein structures reveals that B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is most similar to Pseudomonas cytochromes c(551), followed by cytochromes c(6), Desulfovibrio cytochrome c(553), cytochromes c(552) from thermophiles, and cytochromes c from eukaryotes. Notwithstanding a low sequence homology, a structure-based alignment of these cytochromes shows conservation of three helical regions, with different additional secondary structure motifs characterizing each protein. In B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553), these motifs are represented by the shortest interhelix connecting fragments observed for this group of proteins. The possible relationships between heme solvent accessibility and the electrochemical reduction potential are discussed."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

In this study, diffuse-transmission UV/Vis spectroscopy is used to investigate the in situ spectral reaction of Cr(VI) reduction by c-Cyts in intact Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cells under different incubation conditions. The reduced c-Cyts decreased transiently at the beginning and then recovered gradually over time. The Cr(VI) reduction rates decreased with increasing initial Cr(VI) concentrations, and Cr(III) was identified as a reduced product. The presence of Cr(III) substantially inhibited Cr(VI) reduction and the recovery of reduced c-Cyts, indicating that Cr(III) might inhibit cell growth. Cr(VI) reduction rates increased with increasing cell density. The highest Cr(VI) reduction rate and fastest recovery of c-Cyts were obtained at pH 7.0 and 30\u00b0C, with sodium lactate serving as an electron donor.

Although the role of TorA in the reduction of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been clearly established, no direct evidence for TorC involvement has been presented. TorC belongs to the NirT/NapC c-type cytochrome family based on homologies of its N-terminal tetrahemic domain (TorC(N)) to the cytochromes of this family, but TorC contains a C-terminal extension (TorC(C)) with an additional heme-binding site. In this study, we show that both domains are required for the anaerobic bacterial growth with TMAO. The intact TorC protein and its two domains, TorC(N) and TorC(C), were produced independently and purified for a biochemical characterization. The reduced form of TorC exhibited visible absorption maxima at 552, 523, and 417 nm. Mediated redox potentiometry of the heme centers of the purified components identified two negative midpoint potentials (-177 and -98 mV) localized in the tetrahemic TorC(N) and one positive midpoint potential (+120 mV) in the monohemic TorC(C). In agreement with these values, the in vitro reconstitution of electron transfer between TorC, TorC(N), or TorC(C) and TorA showed that only TorC and TorC(C) were capable of electron transfer to TorA. Surprisingly, interaction studies revealed that only TorC and TorC(N) strongly bind TorA. Therefore, TorC(C) directly transfers electrons to TorA, whereas TorC(N), which probably receives electrons from the menaquinone pool, is involved in both the electron transfer to TorC(C) and the binding to TorA."

The loss of 21-hydroxylase activity caused by this compound exhibits a number of characteristics of mechanism-based inactivation including NADPH dependence, pseudo-first-order kinetics, saturability, irreversibility, and protection by substrate.

The dihalo compounds inactivate P450 C-21 by both heme destruction and protein modification as shown by significant decreases in residual 21-hydroxylase activity and spectrally detectable P450 after incubation with P450 C-21 in a reconstituted system. Liquid chromatographic and mass spectral analyses of the organic extracts from these incubations showed that 21-pregnenoic acid is a major metabolite of the dihalo compounds with a partition ratio of 5 nmol of acid produced/nmol of P450 C-21 inactivated. This supports the hypothesis that inactivation proceeds in part through an acyl halide intermediate. In contrast, the acetylenic compound pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one inactivates P450 C-21 mainly by protein modification, producing an NADPH-dependent irreversible type I spectral shift.

CG-MD self-assembly simulations enable prediction of the orientation and depth of insertion into a lipid bilayer of a monotopic protein, and also of the interactions of individual protein residues with lipid molecules. The CG-MD method has been evaluated via comparison with extended (>30 ns) atomistic simulations of monoamine oxidase, revealing good agreement between the results of coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. CG-MD simulations have been applied to a set of 11 monotopic proteins for which three-dimensional structures are available. These proteins may be divided into two groups on the basis of the results of the simulations. One group consists of those proteins which are inserted into the lipid bilayer to a limited extent, interacting mainly at the phospholipid-water interface. The second group consists of those which are inserted more deeply into the bilayer. Those monotopic proteins which are inserted more deeply cause significant local perturbation of bilayer properties such as bilayer thickness. Deeper insertion seems to correlate with a greater number of basic residues in the \"foot\" whereby a monotopic protein interacts with the membrane."

A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria.

Biochem. 238, 287-295), we found that two molecules of heme B were bound to CtaA. Further, we demonstrated that substitutions of His60 and His126 did not affect heme binding while His216 and His278 in the carboxy-halves are essential in heme binding. And we found that Ala substitutions of Cys191 and Cys197 in loop 5/6 reduced heme content to a half of the wild-type level. On the basis of our findings, we proposed a helical-wheel-projection model of CtaA."

All heme-dependent processes, from protein hemylation to heme signaling, require the dynamic and rapid mobilization of heme to hemoproteins present in virtually every subcellular compartment. The cytotoxicity and hydrophobicity of heme necessitates that heme mobilization is carefully controlled at the cellular and systemic level. However, the molecules and mechanisms that mediate heme homeostasis are poorly understood. In this Account, we provide a heuristic paradigm with which to conceptualize heme trafficking and highlight the most recent developments in the mechanisms underlying heme trafficking. As an iron-containing tetrapyrrole, heme exhibits properties of both transition metals and lipids. Accordingly, we propose its transport and trafficking will reflect principles gleaned from the trafficking of both metals and lipids. Using this conceptual framework, we follow the flow of heme from the final step of heme synthesis in the mitochondria to hemoproteins present in various subcellular organelles. Further, given that many cells and animals that cannot make heme can assimilate it intact from nutritional sources, we propose that intercellular heme trafficking pathways must exist. This necessitates that heme be able to be imported and exported from cells, escorted between cells and organs, and regulated at the organismal level via a coordinated systemic process. In this Account, we highlight recently discovered heme transport and trafficking factors and provide the biochemical foundation for the cell and systems biology of heme. Altogether, we seek to reconceptualize heme from an exchange inert cofactor buried in hemoprotein active sites to an exchange labile and mobile metallonutrient."

Herein, we elucidate the nature and dynamics of LH using genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae We find that the subcellular distribution of LH is heterogeneous; the cytosol maintains LH at \u223c20-40 nM, whereas the mitochondria and nucleus maintain it at concentrations below 2.5 nM. Further, we find that the signaling molecule nitric oxide can initiate the rapid mobilization of heme in the cytosol and nucleus from certain thiol-containing factors. We also find that the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase constitutes a major cellular heme buffer, and is responsible for maintaining the activity of the heme-dependent nuclear transcription factor heme activator protein (Hap1p).

We mutated a target residue in that site (Ser-1412 to Asp) to mimic phosphorylation and then characterized the mutant using conventional and stopped-flow spectroscopies. Compared with wild-type, S1412D nNOS catalyzed faster cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction but displayed slower steady-state NO synthesis with greater uncoupling of NADPH oxidation. Paradoxically, the mutant had faster heme reduction, faster heme-NO complex formation, and greater heme-NO complex accumulation at steady state. To understand how these behaviors related to flavin and heme reduction rates, we utilized three soybean calmodulins (CaMs) that supported a range of slower flavin and heme reduction rates in mutant and wild-type nNOS. Reductase activity and two catalytic parameters (speed and amount of heme-NO complex formation) related directly to the speed of flavin and heme reduction. In contrast, steady-state NO synthesis increased, reached a plateau, and then fell at the highest rate of heme reduction that was obtained with S1412D nNOS + CaM. Substituting with soybean CaM slowed heme reduction and increased steady-state NO synthesis by the mutant. We conclude the following. 1) The S1412D mutation speeds electron transfer out of the reductase domain. 2) Faster heme reduction speeds intrinsic NO synthesis but diminishes NO release in the steady state. 3) Heme reduction displays an optimum regarding NO release during steady state. The unique behavior of S1412D nNOS reveals the importance of heme reduction rate in controlling steady-state activity and suggests that nNOS already has a near-optimal rate of heme reduction."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

CBS activity is absent in heme deficient strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown without heme supplementation. CBS activity can be restored by supplementing these strains with heme, implying that there is a heme requirement for yeast CBS. We subcloned, overexpressed and purified yeast CBS. The yeast enzyme shows absolute pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependence for activity but we could find no evidence for the presence of a heme group. Given the degree of sequence and mechanistic similarity between yeast and human CBS, this result indicates that heme is unlikely to play a direct catalytic role in the human CBS reaction mechanism. Further characterization revealed that, in contrast to human CBS, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) does not activate yeast CBS. Yeast CBS was found to be coordinately regulated with proliferation in S. cerevisiae.

Surface plasmon resonance measurements of annexin I, V, and mutants, which allowed evaluation of membrane aggregation activity of annexin I separately from its membrane binding, revealed direct correlation between the relative membrane aggregation activity and the relative affinity of the secondary interaction site for the secondary membrane. The secondary binding was driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions, unlike calcium-mediated electrostatic primary membrane binding. Chemical cross-linking of membrane-bound annexin I showed that a significant degree of lateral association of annexin I molecules precedes its membrane aggregation.

An interesting feature is the asymmetry of compartments and the existence of a diffusion layer adjacent to only one face of the enzymic membrane. In such a situation the apparent enzyme activity and the product distribution in the system have been studied versus all the possibilities of combination of ATP and glycerol supply. Our approach has lead us to differentiate two different roles played by a diffusion layer adjacent to a permeable enzymic membrane. Depending on the spatial origin of the enzymic substrates (i.e. from which compartment they derive), the diffusion layer can play either the role of a passive additional resistance to that of the membrane or the role of a third compartment in which the reaction product can partially accumulate before splitting on both parts of the membrane. Our results mainly demonstrate that a membrane-bound enzyme activity and the resulting product distribution occurring in a compartmentalized system may be regulated by the cumulative effect due to the asymmetry in volumes of the compartments, the presence of a diffusion layer and the different possibilities of substrate supply.

Measurements of porous and nonporous membrane scattering characteristics before and after membrane pressurization and measurements of receiver linearity indicate that resonance of the gas bodies in the membranes is the origin of the observed difference-frequency amplitudes. Difference-frequency amplitudes in the spectra of signals scattered from the membranes with smaller pores are found to peak at excitation frequencies higher than difference-frequency amplitudes produced by membranes with larger pores and generally follow the predictions of the calculations.

About 70% of the phosphodiesterase activity found in rod outer segments is membrane-bound, and is thought to be anchored to the membrane through C-terminal prenyl groups. The recombinant delta subunit has been shown to solubilize the membrane-bound form of the enzyme. This paper describes the site and mechanism of this interaction in more detail. In isolated rod outer segments, the delta subunit was found exclusively in the soluble fraction, and about 30% of it did not coimmunoprecipitate with the catalytic subunits. The delta subunit that was bound to the catalytic subunits dissociated slowly, with a half-life of about 3.5 h. To determine whether the site of this strong binding was the C-termini of the phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits, peptides corresponding to the C-terminal ends of the alpha and beta subunits were synthesized. Micromolar concentrations of these peptides blocked the phosphodiesterase/delta subunit interaction. Interestingly, this blockade only occurred if the peptides were both prenylated and methylated. These results suggested that a major site of interaction of the delta subunit is the methylated, prenylated C-terminus of the phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits. To determine whether the catalytic subunits of the full-length enzyme are methylated in situ when bound to the delta subunit, we labeled rod outer segments with a tritiated methyl donor. Soluble phosphodiesterase from these rod outer segments was more highly methylated (4.5 +/- 0.3-fold) than the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase, suggesting that the delta subunit bound preferentially to the methylated enzyme in the outer segment. Together these results suggest that the delta subunit/phosphodiesterase catalytic subunit interaction may be regulated by the C-terminal methylation of the catalytic subunits."

For this reason, the thickness of zinc oxide film will be investigated and determined in this study. The interaction of nitric oxide with a 20 nm zinc oxide layer on gold leads to the shift of the resonance angle. The analysis on the reflectance intensity of light demonstrates that such effect is caused by the variation of conductivity and permittivity of zinc oxide film. Finally, a shift in surface plasmon resonance angle was measured in 25 ppm nitric oxide at 180 C and a calibration curve of nitride oxide concentration versus response intensity was successfully obtained in the range of 250 to 1000 ppm nitric oxide at lower temperature of 150 C.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 1-NAME, prevents the formation of nitric oxide and here, 1-NAME inhibited both laminin-mediated and AG73-mediated neurite outgrowth by 88 and 95%, respectively. In contrast, C16, a synthetic peptide derived from the laminin-1-gamma chain, is shown here to promote PC12 cell attachment, but not neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the C16 peptide did not activate nitric oxide release, suggesting that laminin-induced nitric oxide release in PC12 cells is associated only with neurite outgrowth promoting laminin domains and signals. In addition, the data here show that the nitric oxide released by PC12 cells in response to laminin is required as a part of the mechanism of laminin-mediated neurite outgrowth."

We have previously shown that cyclosporine nephrotoxicity alters kidney nitric oxide synthase mRNA pattern of expression. To determine if nitric oxide synthase expression changes are mediated directly by cyclosporine or by secondary hemodynamic alterations induced by cyclosporine, we evaluated if these effects are tissue specific and if nifedipine-induced vasodilation prevents these alterations. Uninephrectomized Wistar rats treated for 7 days with olive oil, cyclosporine (30 mg/kg), nifedipine (3 mg/kg), and nifedipine+cyclosporine were studied. In vehicle and cyclosporine groups, the gene expression of the neuronal, inducible, and endothelial nitric oxide synthases in cerebellum, heart, intestine, liver, renal cortex, and medulla was evaluated. The administration of cyclosporine was associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in renal cortex and liver, and a decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in renal medulla. The mRNA levels of the 3 nitric oxide synthase isoforms were not affected in any other tissue. Nifedipine did not alter nitric oxide synthase expression in the control group but prevented changes associated with cyclosporine. These results suggest that cyclosporine-induced changes in the pattern of expression of the nitric oxide synthases may be secondary to its hemodynamic effects."

Previous studies have reported conflicting results for the roles of nitric oxide in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a major center that regulates sympathetic and cardiovascular activities. We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure. Microinjection of a high dose (100 nmol) of sodium nitroprusside decreased arterial pressure and inhibited spontaneous respiration with concomitant production of peroxynitrite, a strong cytotoxic oxidant. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of L-glutamate were inhibited after preinjection of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol) were inhibited after preinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla.

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Bacillus pasteurii cytochrome c(553), characterized by a low reduction potential and by a low sequence homology with cytochromes from Gram-negative bacteria or eukaryotes, is a useful case study for understanding the structure-function relationships for this class of electron-transfer proteins. Diffraction data on a single crystal of cytochrome c(553) were obtained using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The structure was determined at 0.97-A resolution using ab initio phasing and independently at 1.70 A in an MAD experiment. In both experiments, the structure solution exploited the presence of a single Fe atom as anomalous scatterer in the protein. For the 0.97-A data, the phasing was based on a single data set. This is the most precise structure of a heme protein to date. The crystallized cytochrome c(553) contains only 71 of the 92 residues expected from the intact protein sequence, lacking the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. This feature is consistent with previous evidence that this tail, responsible for anchoring the protein to the cytoplasm membrane, is easily cleaved off during the purification procedure. The heme prosthetic group in B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is surrounded by three alpha-helices in a compact arrangement. The largely exposed c-type heme group features a His-Met axial coordination of the Fe(III) ion. The protein is characterized by a very asymmetric charge distribution, with the exposed heme edge located on a surface patch devoid of net charges. A structural search of a representative set of protein structures reveals that B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is most similar to Pseudomonas cytochromes c(551), followed by cytochromes c(6), Desulfovibrio cytochrome c(553), cytochromes c(552) from thermophiles, and cytochromes c from eukaryotes. Notwithstanding a low sequence homology, a structure-based alignment of these cytochromes shows conservation of three helical regions, with different additional secondary structure motifs characterizing each protein. In B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553), these motifs are represented by the shortest interhelix connecting fragments observed for this group of proteins. The possible relationships between heme solvent accessibility and the electrochemical reduction potential are discussed."

Their interactions with lipid bilayers may be studied via coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. Understanding such interactions is important as monotopic enzymes frequently act on hydrophobic substrates, while X-ray structures rarely provide direct information about their interactions with membranes. CG-MD self-assembly simulations enable prediction of the orientation and depth of insertion into a lipid bilayer of a monotopic protein, and also of the interactions of individual protein residues with lipid molecules. The CG-MD method has been evaluated via comparison with extended (>30 ns) atomistic simulations of monoamine oxidase, revealing good agreement between the results of coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. CG-MD simulations have been applied to a set of 11 monotopic proteins for which three-dimensional structures are available. These proteins may be divided into two groups on the basis of the results of the simulations. One group consists of those proteins which are inserted into the lipid bilayer to a limited extent, interacting mainly at the phospholipid-water interface. The second group consists of those which are inserted more deeply into the bilayer. Those monotopic proteins which are inserted more deeply cause significant local perturbation of bilayer properties such as bilayer thickness. Deeper insertion seems to correlate with a greater number of basic residues in the \"foot\" whereby a monotopic protein interacts with the membrane."

Experimental measurements have shown that pH triggers the dimer formation of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the major ampullate spidroin 1 (MaSp 1). A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data. Our results can contribute to the design of new mutants with specific association properties. "

The CG simulations with explicit lipid and water capture bilayer penetration and pore formation, showing that pore formation is enhanced at high dendrimer concentration, but suppressed at low temperature and high salt concentration, in agreement with experiments. Cationic linear polymers have also been simulated, but do not perforate membranes, evidently because by deforming into a pancake, the charges on a linear polymer achieve intimate contact with a single bilayer leaflet. The relatively rigid dendrimers, on the other hand, penetrate the bilayer, because only by interacting with both leaflets can they achieve a similar degree of contact between charged groups. Also, a \"dendrimer-filled vesicle\" structure for the dendrimer-membrane interaction is predicted by mesoscale thermodynamic simulations, in agreement with a picture derived from experimental observations. In simulations of complexes of dendrimer and polyelectrolyte, anionic linear chains wrap around the cationic dendrimer and penetrate inside it.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex.

From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

Also, there are reports that certain proteins such as cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochrome P-450 are endowed with the nitrite reductase activity in mammalian cells. Keeping these facts in view, we turned our attention to probe whether 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin could alter the levels of nitric oxide independent of the action of nitric oxide synthase in the human platelets model. The incubation of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin and nitrite with platelets caused significant elevation of nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels possibly due to the activation of nitrite reductase. Several polyphenolic acetates were similarly found to activate the nitrite reductase in tune with their affinities as substrate to CRTAase. N-omega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, failed to reverse such an effect of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin. Clotrimazole which is known to be an inhibitor of nitrite reductase, effectively abolished the 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin mediated enhancement of nitric oxide levels in platelets as well as the nitric oxide mediated effects; such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels as well as adenosine diphospate induced platelets aggregation due to nitrite."

The electrical and optical properties of zinc oxide film vary in the presence of nitric oxide. This effect was utilized to prepare biochemical sensors with transduction based on surface plasmon resonance. Due to the refractive index of the transparent zinc oxide film that was deposited on the gold film, however, changes will be observed in the surface plasmon resonance spectra. For this reason, the thickness of zinc oxide film will be investigated and determined in this study. The interaction of nitric oxide with a 20 nm zinc oxide layer on gold leads to the shift of the resonance angle. The analysis on the reflectance intensity of light demonstrates that such effect is caused by the variation of conductivity and permittivity of zinc oxide film. Finally, a shift in surface plasmon resonance angle was measured in 25 ppm nitric oxide at 180 C and a calibration curve of nitride oxide concentration versus response intensity was successfully obtained in the range of 250 to 1000 ppm nitric oxide at lower temperature of 150 C.

These differences are not only located at the 3-phosphoglycerate binding site but are also seen as long-range effects at the surface of the protein. Measurements of the Kd for 3-phosphoglycerate from the NMR experiments show that the mutant enzyme has a 30-times reduced affinity for this substrate as compared with the wild-type enzyme.

No detectable helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain is associated with either response regulator, but an HPt domain and a second receiver domain are predicted at the C-terminal region of CbbRR1 and CbbRR2, respectively. The abundance of conserved residues predicted to participate in a His-Asp phosphorelay raised the question of their de facto involvement. In this study, the role of the multiple receiver domains was elucidated in vitro by generating site-directed mutants of the putative conserved residues. Distinct phosphorylation patterns were obtained with two truncated versions of the hybrid sensor kinase, CbbSR(T189) and CbbSR(R96) (CbbSR beginning at residues T189 and R96, respectively). These constructs also exhibited substantially different affinities for ATP and phosphorylation stability, which was found to be dependent on a conserved Asp residue (Asp-696) within the kinase receiver domain. Asp-696 also played an important role in defining the specificity of phosphorylation for response regulators CbbRR1 or CbbRR2, and this residue appeared to act in conjunction with residues within the region from Arg-96 to Thr-189 at the N terminus of the sensor kinase. The net effect of concerted interactions at these distinct regions of CbbSR created an internal molecular switch that appears to coordinate a unique branched phosphorelay system."

The NPF residues are almost completely embedded in a hydrophobic pocket on the EH domain surface and the backbone of NPFX adopts a conformation reminiscent of the Asx-Pro type I beta-turn motif. The residue directly following NPF is crucial for recognition and is required to complete the beta-turn.

Bezanilla, and D.M. Papazian. 2000. J. Gen. Physiol. 115:319-337). To exert its effect, Mg(2+) presumably binds to a site in or near the eag voltage sensor. We have tested the hypothesis that acidic residues unique to eag family members, located in transmembrane segments S2 and S3, contribute to the Mg(2+)-binding site. Two eag-specific acidic residues and three acidic residues found in the S2 and S3 segments of all voltage-dependent K(+) channels were individually mutated in Drosophila eag, mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the effect of Mg(2+) on ionic current kinetics was measured using a two electrode voltage clamp. Neutralization of eag-specific residues D278 in S2 and D327 in S3 eliminated Mg(2+)-sensitivity and mimicked the slowing of activation kinetics caused by Mg(2+) binding to the wild-type channel. These results suggest that Mg(2+) modulates activation kinetics in wild-type eag by screening the negatively charged side chains of D278 and D327. Therefore, these residues are likely to coordinate the bound ion. In contrast, neutralization of the widely conserved residues D284 in S2 and D319 in S3 preserved the fast kinetics seen in wild-type eag in the absence of Mg(2+), indicating that D284 and D319 do not mediate the slowing of activation caused by Mg(2+) binding. Mutations at D284 affected the eag gating pathway, shifting the voltage dependence of Mg(2+)-sensitive, rate limiting transitions in the hyperpolarized direction. Another widely conserved residue, D274 in S2, is not required for Mg(2+) sensitivity but is in the vicinity of the binding site. We conclude that Mg(2+) binds in a water-filled pocket between S2 and S3 and thereby modulates voltage-dependent gating. The identification of this site constrains the packing of transmembrane segments in the voltage sensor of K(+) channels, and suggests a molecular mechanism by which extracellular cations modulate eag activation kinetics."

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Using the human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, and 14 different compounds (4 nonsteroidal antiestrogens, 6 oxysterols with appreciable binding affinities for the antiestrogen-binding site, and 4 other sterols with little or no affinity for this site), we showed that for compounds which bound to the antiestrogen-binding site, there was a clear positive correlation between their relative cytotoxic potencies and their affinities for this binding site. Two sterols, namely 25-hydroxycholesterol and 20 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, were exceptions to this general pattern, both clearly inhibited cell proliferation without having significant binding affinity for the antiestrogen-binding site. The same general order of antiproliferative potency of the oxysterols seen with MCF7 cells was also observed with the murine lymphoma cell line EL4.

Bacillus pasteurii cytochrome c(553), characterized by a low reduction potential and by a low sequence homology with cytochromes from Gram-negative bacteria or eukaryotes, is a useful case study for understanding the structure-function relationships for this class of electron-transfer proteins. Diffraction data on a single crystal of cytochrome c(553) were obtained using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The structure was determined at 0.97-A resolution using ab initio phasing and independently at 1.70 A in an MAD experiment. In both experiments, the structure solution exploited the presence of a single Fe atom as anomalous scatterer in the protein. For the 0.97-A data, the phasing was based on a single data set. This is the most precise structure of a heme protein to date. The crystallized cytochrome c(553) contains only 71 of the 92 residues expected from the intact protein sequence, lacking the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. This feature is consistent with previous evidence that this tail, responsible for anchoring the protein to the cytoplasm membrane, is easily cleaved off during the purification procedure. The heme prosthetic group in B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is surrounded by three alpha-helices in a compact arrangement. The largely exposed c-type heme group features a His-Met axial coordination of the Fe(III) ion. The protein is characterized by a very asymmetric charge distribution, with the exposed heme edge located on a surface patch devoid of net charges.

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130.

We report the 1.95 and 1.35 A resolution crystal structures of the CO- and NO-bound forms of the reduced protein from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. NO disrupts the His-Fe bond and binds in a novel mode to the proximal face of the heme, giving a 5-coordinate species. In contrast, CO binds 6-coordinate on the distal side. A second CO molecule, not bound to the heme, is located in the proximal pocket.

However, the in situ redox status of OM c-Cyts during microbial metal reduction processes remain poorly understood. In this study, diffuse-transmission UV/Vis spectroscopy is used to investigate the in situ spectral reaction of Cr(VI) reduction by c-Cyts in intact Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cells under different incubation conditions. The reduced c-Cyts decreased transiently at the beginning and then recovered gradually over time. The Cr(VI) reduction rates decreased with increasing initial Cr(VI) concentrations, and Cr(III) was identified as a reduced product. The presence of Cr(III) substantially inhibited Cr(VI) reduction and the recovery of reduced c-Cyts, indicating that Cr(III) might inhibit cell growth. Cr(VI) reduction rates increased with increasing cell density. The highest Cr(VI) reduction rate and fastest recovery of c-Cyts were obtained at pH 7.0 and 30\u00b0C, with sodium lactate serving as an electron donor. The presence of O2 strongly inhibited Cr(VI) reduction, suggesting that O2 might compete with Cr(VI) as an electron acceptor in cells. This study provides a case of directly examining in vivo reaction properties of an outer-membrane enzyme during microbial metal reduction processes under non-invasive physiological conditions. "

Although the role of TorA in the reduction of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been clearly established, no direct evidence for TorC involvement has been presented. TorC belongs to the NirT/NapC c-type cytochrome family based on homologies of its N-terminal tetrahemic domain (TorC(N)) to the cytochromes of this family, but TorC contains a C-terminal extension (TorC(C)) with an additional heme-binding site. In this study, we show that both domains are required for the anaerobic bacterial growth with TMAO. The intact TorC protein and its two domains, TorC(N) and TorC(C), were produced independently and purified for a biochemical characterization. The reduced form of TorC exhibited visible absorption maxima at 552, 523, and 417 nm. Mediated redox potentiometry of the heme centers of the purified components identified two negative midpoint potentials (-177 and -98 mV) localized in the tetrahemic TorC(N) and one positive midpoint potential (+120 mV) in the monohemic TorC(C). In agreement with these values, the in vitro reconstitution of electron transfer between TorC, TorC(N), or TorC(C) and TorA showed that only TorC and TorC(C) were capable of electron transfer to TorA. Surprisingly, interaction studies revealed that only TorC and TorC(N) strongly bind TorA. Therefore, TorC(C) directly transfers electrons to TorA, whereas TorC(N), which probably receives electrons from the menaquinone pool, is involved in both the electron transfer to TorC(C) and the binding to TorA."

The SWNT properties are modified systematically by varying the annealing temperature between 350 to 550 degrees C under vacuum. Thermal annealing is not only necessary to remove dispersant used for nanotube dispersion but also plays an important role in optimizing the gas sensing abilities. In this paper, the sensing performance is evaluated through three crucial sensing characteristics: sensitivity to NO(2), humidity interfering effect, and sensor stability over repeated use, all examined at room temperature. The sensor annealed at 400 degrees C shows the highest NO(2) sensitivity because of the structural properties, i.e., high specific surface area and the molecular geometry of having all carbon atoms at the tube-surface. The sensor also shows negligible humidity interfering effect and high sensor stability, originating from the hydrophobicity and chemical stability of the material, respectively. In contrast, annealing temperatures higher than 400 degrees C lead to structural defects in SWNTs and thus lower the sensing performance. We experimentally confirm that these SWNT characteristics make SWNTs a suitable gas sensing material from a practical perspective."

CG-MD self-assembly simulations enable prediction of the orientation and depth of insertion into a lipid bilayer of a monotopic protein, and also of the interactions of individual protein residues with lipid molecules. The CG-MD method has been evaluated via comparison with extended (>30 ns) atomistic simulations of monoamine oxidase, revealing good agreement between the results of coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. CG-MD simulations have been applied to a set of 11 monotopic proteins for which three-dimensional structures are available. These proteins may be divided into two groups on the basis of the results of the simulations. One group consists of those proteins which are inserted into the lipid bilayer to a limited extent, interacting mainly at the phospholipid-water interface. The second group consists of those which are inserted more deeply into the bilayer. Those monotopic proteins which are inserted more deeply cause significant local perturbation of bilayer properties such as bilayer thickness. Deeper insertion seems to correlate with a greater number of basic residues in the \"foot\" whereby a monotopic protein interacts with the membrane."

A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data.

The CG simulations with explicit lipid and water capture bilayer penetration and pore formation, showing that pore formation is enhanced at high dendrimer concentration, but suppressed at low temperature and high salt concentration, in agreement with experiments. Cationic linear polymers have also been simulated, but do not perforate membranes, evidently because by deforming into a pancake, the charges on a linear polymer achieve intimate contact with a single bilayer leaflet. The relatively rigid dendrimers, on the other hand, penetrate the bilayer, because only by interacting with both leaflets can they achieve a similar degree of contact between charged groups. Also, a \"dendrimer-filled vesicle\" structure for the dendrimer-membrane interaction is predicted by mesoscale thermodynamic simulations, in agreement with a picture derived from experimental observations. In simulations of complexes of dendrimer and polyelectrolyte, anionic linear chains wrap around the cationic dendrimer and penetrate inside it.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

The cytotoxicity and hydrophobicity of heme necessitates that heme mobilization is carefully controlled at the cellular and systemic level. However, the molecules and mechanisms that mediate heme homeostasis are poorly understood. In this Account, we provide a heuristic paradigm with which to conceptualize heme trafficking and highlight the most recent developments in the mechanisms underlying heme trafficking. As an iron-containing tetrapyrrole, heme exhibits properties of both transition metals and lipids. Accordingly, we propose its transport and trafficking will reflect principles gleaned from the trafficking of both metals and lipids. Using this conceptual framework, we follow the flow of heme from the final step of heme synthesis in the mitochondria to hemoproteins present in various subcellular organelles. Further, given that many cells and animals that cannot make heme can assimilate it intact from nutritional sources, we propose that intercellular heme trafficking pathways must exist. This necessitates that heme be able to be imported and exported from cells, escorted between cells and organs, and regulated at the organismal level via a coordinated systemic process. In this Account, we highlight recently discovered heme transport and trafficking factors and provide the biochemical foundation for the cell and systems biology of heme.

Compared with wild-type, S1412D nNOS catalyzed faster cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction but displayed slower steady-state NO synthesis with greater uncoupling of NADPH oxidation. Paradoxically, the mutant had faster heme reduction, faster heme-NO complex formation, and greater heme-NO complex accumulation at steady state. To understand how these behaviors related to flavin and heme reduction rates, we utilized three soybean calmodulins (CaMs) that supported a range of slower flavin and heme reduction rates in mutant and wild-type nNOS. Reductase activity and two catalytic parameters (speed and amount of heme-NO complex formation) related directly to the speed of flavin and heme reduction. In contrast, steady-state NO synthesis increased, reached a plateau, and then fell at the highest rate of heme reduction that was obtained with S1412D nNOS + CaM. Substituting with soybean CaM slowed heme reduction and increased steady-state NO synthesis by the mutant. We conclude the following. 1) The S1412D mutation speeds electron transfer out of the reductase domain. 2) Faster heme reduction speeds intrinsic NO synthesis but diminishes NO release in the steady state. 3) Heme reduction displays an optimum regarding NO release during steady state. The unique behavior of S1412D nNOS reveals the importance of heme reduction rate in controlling steady-state activity and suggests that nNOS already has a near-optimal rate of heme reduction."

A novel assay, an artificial-enzyme membrane was designed and synthesized for sensor fabrication. This artificial-enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the diphosphoric acid anhydride structure. This structure-selective, albeit not molecule-selective, catalytic hydrolysis was successfully coupled with amperometric detection. Since the catalytic reaction produces a dephosphorylation product (PO(4)(3-)), it can be reduced by an electrode potential of -250 mV vs. Ag/AgCl. Owing to the structural selectivity of the artificial-enzyme membrane, the sensor can detect biological phosphoric substances comprehensively that have the diphosphoric acid anhydride structure. The sensor successfully determined various biological phosphoric substances at concentrations in the micromolar (microM) to millimolar (mM) range, and it showed good functional stability and reproducibility in terms of sensor responses. This sensor was used to detect Escherichia coli lysed by heat treatment, and the response increased with increasing bacterial numbers. This unique technique for analyzing molecular commonality can be applied to the surveillance of biocontaminants, e.g. microorganisms, spores and viruses. Artificial-enzyme-based detection is a novel strategy for practical biosurveillance in the front line."

To better understand the mechanism of annexin I-mediated membrane aggregation, we investigated the properties of the inducible secondary interaction site implicated in membrane aggregation. X-ray specular reflectivity measurements showed that the thickness of annexin I layer bound to the phospholipid monolayer was 31 +/- 2 A, indicating that annexin I binds membranes as a protein monomer or monolayer. Surface plasmon resonance measurements of annexin I, V, and mutants, which allowed evaluation of membrane aggregation activity of annexin I separately from its membrane binding, revealed direct correlation between the relative membrane aggregation activity and the relative affinity of the secondary interaction site for the secondary membrane. The secondary binding was driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions, unlike calcium-mediated electrostatic primary membrane binding. Chemical cross-linking of membrane-bound annexin I showed that a significant degree of lateral association of annexin I molecules precedes its membrane aggregation. Taken together, these results support a hypothetical model of annexin I-mediated membrane aggregation, in which a laterally aggregated monolayer of membrane-bound annexin I directly interacts with a secondary membrane via its induced hydrophobic interaction site."

The sensor is characterized by very low detection limits (<20 nM), good long-term stability, and can be employed for the rapid detection of total low-molecular-weight (LMW) RSNO levels in whole blood samples using a simple standard addition method. A strategy for detecting macromolecular RSNOs is also demonstrated via use of a transnitrosation reaction with added LMW thiols allowing the estimation of total RSNO levels in blood.

This sensor is based on a pH-dependent color change of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). For the sensitive detection, a visible attenuated total reflection spectrometer with a slab optical waveguide (SOWG) was laboratory-made, and the guiding layer surface was modified with a PPIX-immobilized acrylamide-based thin membrane. The sensing membrane with a thickness of approximately 1 mum was directly fabricated on the SOWG glass surface by copolymerization of acrylamide, N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide, and PPIX in the narrow space confined by a cover plate. PPIX possesses two double bonds in its structure, and so it can be covalently incorporated into the membrane. The response characteristics of the PPIX-immobilized optode membrane were explored using aqueous solutions with different concentrations of HNO(3) or HCl. The optode membrane provided characteristic Soret band absorption spectra depending on the hydrogen ion concentration; the absorbance at 410 nm increased with increasing the concentrations in the range of 0.15-2 M, corresponding to the range of pH -0.3 to 0.8. The absorption signal reached 90% of its final value within 10 s, while the absorption signal was quite readily returned to background level simply by passing 2 mL of distilled water through a flow cell with a volume of 16.5 muL placed on the SOWG. Due to the rapid response and reversibility, this sensor could be operated in a flow-through mode as well as in a conventional static mode, where deionized water was conveniently used as a carrier and conditioning solution. In terms of the stability and precision, this sensor showed no significant change in response even after 100 assays and after being stored in a dry condition for over 6 months. Relative standard deviations for 10 replicate measurements were less than 1.8% in the linear range, and the detection limit calculated from 3 times of the standard deviation was 0.02 pH unit."

The effective refractive index, determined from the resonance incoupling angle detected at high accuracy, allows determination of layer thickness and coverage (or mass) of the adsorbed or bound material with ultrahigh sensitivity.

Ofd1, a prolyl 4-hydroxylase-like 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase, controls the oxygen-dependent stability of Sre1N. In the presence of oxygen, Ofd1 accelerates the degradation of Sre1N, but under low oxygen Ofd1 is inhibited and Sre1N accumulates. To identify the regulators of Sre1N, we performed a plasmid-based screen for genes that increased Sre1N transcriptional activity. Here, we identify Nro1 (SPCC4B3.07) as a positive regulator of Sre1N stability and a direct inhibitor of Ofd1. In the absence of oxygen, Nro1 binds to the Ofd1 C-terminal degradation domain and inhibits Sre1N degradation. In the presence of oxygen, Nro1 binding to Ofd1 is disrupted, leading to rapid degradation of Sre1N. We conclude that the Ofd1 dioxygenase domain functions as an oxygen sensor that regulates binding of Nro1 to Ofd1 to control oxygen-dependent Sre1N stability."

Measurements of the Kd for 3-phosphoglycerate from the NMR experiments show that the mutant enzyme has a 30-times reduced affinity for this substrate as compared with the wild-type enzyme.

At residue Arg-69, a lysine substitution was least disruptive, conferring an apparent K(d) of 0.3 mm for aspartate. Results obtained for an alanine mutant were similar to those with cysteine and histidine mutants (K(d) approximately 5 mm) indicating that side chain size was not an important factor here. Proline and aspartate caused more severe defects, presumably for reasons related to conformation and charge. The impact of residue 69 mutations on the maltose response was small. Mutations at Arg-73 had similar effects on aspartate binding (K(d) 0.3-7 mm) but more severe consequences for maltose responses. Larger side chains resulted in the best aspartate binding, implying steric considerations are important here. Signaling in the mutant proteins was surprisingly robust.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described.

These similarities suggest that conserved residues in TrpRS may be responsible for both determining tryptophan recognition and discrimination against tyrosine. This was investigated by the systematic mutation of TrpRS residues based upon the identity of homologous positions in TyrRS. Of the four residues which interact directly with the aromatic side chain of tryptophan (Phe5, Met129, Asp132, and Val141) replacements of Asp132 led to significant changes in the catalytic efficiency of Trp aminoacylation (200-1250-fold reduction in k(cat)/K(M)) and substitution of Val141 by the larger Glu side chain reduced k(cat)/K(M) by 300-fold. Mutation of Pro127, which determines the position of active-site residues, did not significantly effect Trp binding. Of the mutants tested, D132N TrpRS also showed a significant reduction in discrimination against Tyr, with Tyr acting as a competitive inhibitor but not a substrate. The analogous residue in B. stearothermophilusTyrRS (Asp176) has also been implicated as a determinant of amino acid specificity in earlier studies [de Prat Gay, G., Duckworth, H. W., and Fersht, A.

The reactive derivative (CH3)2AsSR is formed by the reduction of cacodylate by a thiol. The As(III) derivative binds to the enzyme by mercaptide exchange with a cysteine (Cys) residue located close to a tryptophan (Trp) site. The arsenical binding selectively induces an external heavy-atom effect, perturbing the nearby Trp residue in the enzyme. Zero-field splittings (ZFS) and total decay rate constants of the individual triplet-state sublevels of the Trp residue in the presence and absence of perturbation by As(III) have been determined. The perturbed Trp shows a large reduction in the overall decay lifetime compared with unperturbed Trp residue, exhibiting a high selectively for the Tx sublevel. This selectivity suggests that the As atom lies in the xz plane of the principal magnetic axis system of Trp, but not directly along the z (out-of-plane) axis. The accessibility of this enzyme binding site to the arsenical is decreased upon forming a ternary complex of methylase with sinefungin and a DNA oligomer, d[GCGAA(BrU)(BrU)CGC], containing two 5-bromouracil (BrU) bases in place of thymine within the hexadeoxynucleotide recognition sequence. This result indicates that the arsenical binding site in methylase which produces the Trp heavy-atom effect is protected from this ligand by ternary complex formation or the enzyme undergoes a conformation change, removing the Cys from the Trp site.

Diffraction data on a single crystal of cytochrome c(553) were obtained using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The structure was determined at 0.97-A resolution using ab initio phasing and independently at 1.70 A in an MAD experiment. In both experiments, the structure solution exploited the presence of a single Fe atom as anomalous scatterer in the protein. For the 0.97-A data, the phasing was based on a single data set. This is the most precise structure of a heme protein to date. The crystallized cytochrome c(553) contains only 71 of the 92 residues expected from the intact protein sequence, lacking the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. This feature is consistent with previous evidence that this tail, responsible for anchoring the protein to the cytoplasm membrane, is easily cleaved off during the purification procedure.

CG-MD self-assembly simulations enable prediction of the orientation and depth of insertion into a lipid bilayer of a monotopic protein, and also of the interactions of individual protein residues with lipid molecules. The CG-MD method has been evaluated via comparison with extended (>30 ns) atomistic simulations of monoamine oxidase, revealing good agreement between the results of coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. CG-MD simulations have been applied to a set of 11 monotopic proteins for which three-dimensional structures are available. These proteins may be divided into two groups on the basis of the results of the simulations. One group consists of those proteins which are inserted into the lipid bilayer to a limited extent, interacting mainly at the phospholipid-water interface. The second group consists of those which are inserted more deeply into the bilayer. Those monotopic proteins which are inserted more deeply cause significant local perturbation of bilayer properties such as bilayer thickness. Deeper insertion seems to correlate with a greater number of basic residues in the \"foot\" whereby a monotopic protein interacts with the membrane."

Both alpha-spectrin and beta-spectrin polypeptides consist primarily of triple coiled-coil modular repeat units, and two important factors that determine spectrin flexibility are the bending flexibility between two consecutive repeat units and the conformational flexibility of individual repeat units. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used here to study double spectrin repeat units (DSRUs) from the human erythrocyte beta-spectrin (HEbeta89) and the chicken brain alpha-spectrin (CBalpha1617). From the results of MD simulations, a highly conserved Trp residue in the A-helix of most repeat units that has been suggested to be important in conferring stability to the coiled-coil structures is found not to have a significant effect on the conformational flexibility of individual repeat units. Characterization of the bending flexibility for two consecutive repeats of spectrin via atomistic simulations and coarse-grained (CG) modeling indicate that the bending flexibility is governed by the interactions between the AB-loop of the first repeat unit, the BC-loop of the second repeat unit and the linker region. Specifically, interactions between residues in these regions can lead to a strong directionality in the bending behavior of two repeat units.

A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data.

The CG simulations with explicit lipid and water capture bilayer penetration and pore formation, showing that pore formation is enhanced at high dendrimer concentration, but suppressed at low temperature and high salt concentration, in agreement with experiments. Cationic linear polymers have also been simulated, but do not perforate membranes, evidently because by deforming into a pancake, the charges on a linear polymer achieve intimate contact with a single bilayer leaflet. The relatively rigid dendrimers, on the other hand, penetrate the bilayer, because only by interacting with both leaflets can they achieve a similar degree of contact between charged groups. Also, a \"dendrimer-filled vesicle\" structure for the dendrimer-membrane interaction is predicted by mesoscale thermodynamic simulations, in agreement with a picture derived from experimental observations. In simulations of complexes of dendrimer and polyelectrolyte, anionic linear chains wrap around the cationic dendrimer and penetrate inside it.

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family."

It was observed that replacement of the Phe-87 in the P450BM3 by the smaller glycyl residue was essential for the modification to proceed, as the wild-type enzyme showed no spectral changes under identical conditions. The kinetics of this reaction were examined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry with 3-phenylpropionaldehyde and 3-phenylbutyraldehyde as reactants. In each case, the process of heme modification was biphasic, with initial bleaching of the Soret absorbance, followed by an increase in absorbance centered at 430 nm, consistent with meso-heme adduct formation. The intermediate formed during phase I also showed an increased absorbance between 700 and 900 nm, relative to the native heme and the final product. Phase I showed a linear dependence on peroxide concentration, whereas saturation kinetics were observed for phase II. All of these observations are consistent with a mechanism involving radical attack at the gamma-meso position of the heme cofactor, resulting in the intermediate formation of an isoporphyrin, the deprotonation of which produces the gamma-meso-alkyl heme derivative."

In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics.

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

In the WT-HRP enzyme current molecular dynamics simulations show, for the first time, that Arg38 residue: i) prevents the entrance of water inside the reaction cavity, hence providing a hydrophobic reactive scenario, ii) it maintains the distance between His42 and heme-H(2)O(2) complex suitable for the occurrence of proton transfer reaction leading, thereafter, to heme-H(2)O(2) disruption according to Poulos-Kraut mechanism. On the other hand, R38L mutant can be considered as a \"wet enzyme\" where the presence of water solvent molecules in the heme reaction pocket, unfavoring the initial heme-H(2)O(2) complex formation, decreases the catalytic efficiency in agreement with experimental kinetics measurements. Furthermore, we note that Arg38Leu mutation pushes the His42 residue far from the heme-H(2)O(2) complex, making unlikely a direct proton transfer and suggesting that, in the mutant, a solvent water molecule could be involved in the first step of the Poulos-Kraut mechanism."

Compared with wild-type, S1412D nNOS catalyzed faster cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction but displayed slower steady-state NO synthesis with greater uncoupling of NADPH oxidation. Paradoxically, the mutant had faster heme reduction, faster heme-NO complex formation, and greater heme-NO complex accumulation at steady state. To understand how these behaviors related to flavin and heme reduction rates, we utilized three soybean calmodulins (CaMs) that supported a range of slower flavin and heme reduction rates in mutant and wild-type nNOS. Reductase activity and two catalytic parameters (speed and amount of heme-NO complex formation) related directly to the speed of flavin and heme reduction. In contrast, steady-state NO synthesis increased, reached a plateau, and then fell at the highest rate of heme reduction that was obtained with S1412D nNOS + CaM. Substituting with soybean CaM slowed heme reduction and increased steady-state NO synthesis by the mutant. We conclude the following. 1) The S1412D mutation speeds electron transfer out of the reductase domain. 2) Faster heme reduction speeds intrinsic NO synthesis but diminishes NO release in the steady state. 3) Heme reduction displays an optimum regarding NO release during steady state. The unique behavior of S1412D nNOS reveals the importance of heme reduction rate in controlling steady-state activity and suggests that nNOS already has a near-optimal rate of heme reduction."

The OSCN(-) ion interacts with the heme iron, Gln-105 N(epsilon1), His-109 N(epsilon2), and a water molecule W96. The sulfur atom of the OSCN(-) ion forms a hypervalent bond with a nitrogen atom of the pyrrole ring D of the heme moiety at an S-N distance of 2.8 A.

In addition, a least-squares fit of the data to a harmonic wave function indicated that both periodicity and frequency are typical for an amphipathic alpha-helix (3.75 +/- 0.1 residues per turn for helix 4 and 3.70 +/- 0.1 residues per turn for helix 5). Squared residual plots of the harmonic wave function also reveal that the N-terminus of helix 4 is elongated by two residues from Lys-406 to Phe-404, while the C-terminus of helix 5 is elongated by three residues from Tyr-434 to Ile-437 upon membrane association."

Apg8/Aut7, which plays an important role in the formation of such vesicles, tends to bind to membranes in spite of its hydrophilic nature. We show here that the nature of the association of Apg8 with membranes changes depending on a series of modifications of the protein itself. First, the carboxy-terminal Arg residue of newly synthesized Apg8 is removed by Apg4/Aut2, a novel cysteine protease, and a Gly residue becomes the carboxy-terminal residue of the protein that is now designated Apg8FG. Subsequently, Apg8FG forms a conjugate with an unidentified molecule \"X\" and thereby binds tightly to membranes. This modification requires the carboxy-terminal Gly residue of Apg8FG and Apg7, a ubiquitin E1-like enzyme. Finally, the adduct Apg8FG-X is reversed to soluble or loosely membrane-bound Apg8FG by cleavage by Apg4. The mode of action of Apg4, which cleaves both newly synthesized Apg8 and modified Apg8FG, resembles that of deubiquitinating enzymes. A reaction similar to ubiquitination is probably involved in the second modification. The reversible modification of Apg8 appears to be coupled to the membrane dynamics of autophagy and the Cvt pathway."

Because the structure of the water-soluble form of this fragment has been determined by X-ray crystallography, these spectroscopic methods provided valuable information on the secondary structure and the environment of aromatic residues within the two forms of the peptide. These results strongly suggest that the pore-forming domain of colicin A does not undergo drastic unfolding upon insertion into membrane. The conformational change associated with this process is triggered by the negatively charged lipids and probably consists of a reorientation of helix pairs with respect to each other. Exposure of the aromatic residues to the aqueous phase decreases on binding to lipids whilst the exposure of the tryptophans to the membrane phase increases. This cannot occur without a reorientation of helices 3-10. All data from this study support the model presented previously in which the known crystal structure opens like an 'umbrella' inserting the hydrophobic hairpin (helix 8-9) perpendicular to the membrane plane and the helical pair 1-2 and the domain containing the three tryptophans (helices 3-7) lying more or less parallel to the membrane plane. Lipids are bound more tightly to the protein at acidic pH than at neutral pH although a similar lipid protein complex is formed with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero(3)-phospho(1)- -sn-glycerol at both pH values."

In the present study, CD spectroscopy was used to investigate the conformation of the tail in different environments, and as a function of temperature, with the goal of understanding the nature of the membrane-bound conformation. Whereas residue property profiling indicates that bending of a helix in the middle of the peptide might be possible, the experimental results in small unilamellar vesicles and lysophosphatidylcholine micelles are more consistent with a single transmembrane helix. Furthermore, although there is evidence for some refolding of the polypeptide with temperature, this is not consistent with a hairpin-to-transmembrane transition. Rather, it appears to represent an increase in helical content in fluid lipid environments, perhaps involving residues at the ends of the transmembrane segment."

This is especially challenging for membrane proteins because they are embedded within cellular bilayers that provide a unique medium in which hydrophobic sequences must fold. Knowledge of the energetics of protein-lipid interactions is thus vital to understand cellular processes involving membrane proteins. Here we used a host-guest mutational strategy to calculate the Gibbs free energy changes of water-to-lipid transfer for the aromatic side chains Trp, Tyr, and Phe as a function of depth in the membrane. This work reveals an energetic gradient in the transfer free energies for Trp and Tyr, where transfer was most favorable to the membrane interfacial region and comparatively less favorable into the bilayer center. The transfer energetics follows the concentration gradient of polar atoms across the bilayer normal that naturally occurs in biological membranes. Additional measurements revealed nearest-neighbor coupling in the data set are influenced by a network of aromatic side chains in the host protein. Taken together, these results show that aromatic side chains contribute significantly to membrane protein stability through either aromatic-aromatic interactions or placement at the membrane interface.

The predominant form of CIRL is a membrane-bound complex of two subunits, p120 and p85. Extracellularly oriented p120 contains hydrophilic cell adhesion domains, whereas p85 is a heptahelical membrane protein. Both subunits are encoded by the same gene and represent products of intracellular proteolytic processing of the CIRL precursor. In this study, we demonstrate that a soluble form of CIRL also exists in vitro and in vivo. It results from the further cleavage of CIRL by a second protease. The site of the second cleavage is located in the short N-terminal extracellular tail of p85, between the GPS domain and the first transmembrane segment of CIRL. Thus, the soluble form of CIRL represents a complex of p120 noncovalently bound to a 15 amino acid residue N-terminal peptide fragment of p85. We have previously shown that mutations of CIRL in the GPS domain inhibit intracellular proteolytic processing and also result in the absence of the receptors from the cell surface. Our current data suggest that although CIRL trafficking to the cell membrane is impaired by mutations in the GPS region, it is not blocked completely. However, at the cell surface, the noncleaved mutants are preferentially targeted by the second protease that sheds the extracellular subunit. Therefore, the two-step proteolytic processing may represent a regulatory mechanism that controls cell surface expression of membrane-bound and soluble forms of CIRL."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

Bacillus pasteurii cytochrome c(553), characterized by a low reduction potential and by a low sequence homology with cytochromes from Gram-negative bacteria or eukaryotes, is a useful case study for understanding the structure-function relationships for this class of electron-transfer proteins. Diffraction data on a single crystal of cytochrome c(553) were obtained using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The structure was determined at 0.97-A resolution using ab initio phasing and independently at 1.70 A in an MAD experiment. In both experiments, the structure solution exploited the presence of a single Fe atom as anomalous scatterer in the protein. For the 0.97-A data, the phasing was based on a single data set. This is the most precise structure of a heme protein to date. The crystallized cytochrome c(553) contains only 71 of the 92 residues expected from the intact protein sequence, lacking the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. This feature is consistent with previous evidence that this tail, responsible for anchoring the protein to the cytoplasm membrane, is easily cleaved off during the purification procedure. The heme prosthetic group in B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is surrounded by three alpha-helices in a compact arrangement. The largely exposed c-type heme group features a His-Met axial coordination of the Fe(III) ion. The protein is characterized by a very asymmetric charge distribution, with the exposed heme edge located on a surface patch devoid of net charges. A structural search of a representative set of protein structures reveals that B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is most similar to Pseudomonas cytochromes c(551), followed by cytochromes c(6), Desulfovibrio cytochrome c(553), cytochromes c(552) from thermophiles, and cytochromes c from eukaryotes. Notwithstanding a low sequence homology, a structure-based alignment of these cytochromes shows conservation of three helical regions, with different additional secondary structure motifs characterizing each protein. In B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553), these motifs are represented by the shortest interhelix connecting fragments observed for this group of proteins.

Although the role of TorA in the reduction of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been clearly established, no direct evidence for TorC involvement has been presented. TorC belongs to the NirT/NapC c-type cytochrome family based on homologies of its N-terminal tetrahemic domain (TorC(N)) to the cytochromes of this family, but TorC contains a C-terminal extension (TorC(C)) with an additional heme-binding site. In this study, we show that both domains are required for the anaerobic bacterial growth with TMAO. The intact TorC protein and its two domains, TorC(N) and TorC(C), were produced independently and purified for a biochemical characterization. The reduced form of TorC exhibited visible absorption maxima at 552, 523, and 417 nm. Mediated redox potentiometry of the heme centers of the purified components identified two negative midpoint potentials (-177 and -98 mV) localized in the tetrahemic TorC(N) and one positive midpoint potential (+120 mV) in the monohemic TorC(C). In agreement with these values, the in vitro reconstitution of electron transfer between TorC, TorC(N), or TorC(C) and TorA showed that only TorC and TorC(C) were capable of electron transfer to TorA. Surprisingly, interaction studies revealed that only TorC and TorC(N) strongly bind TorA.

CG-MD self-assembly simulations enable prediction of the orientation and depth of insertion into a lipid bilayer of a monotopic protein, and also of the interactions of individual protein residues with lipid molecules.

Gating-modifier toxins such as SGTx1 are of interest as they can be used to probe the structure and dynamics of their target channels. Although there are experimental data for SGTx1, its interaction with lipid bilayer membranes remains to be characterized. We performed atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the interaction of SGTx1 with a POPC and a 3:1 POPE/POPG lipid bilayer membrane. We reveal the preferential partitioning of SGTx1 into the water/membrane interface of the bilayer. We also show that electrostatic interactions between the charged residues of SGTx1 and the lipid headgroups play an important role in stabilizing SGTx1 in a bilayer environment."

Experimental measurements have shown that pH triggers the dimer formation of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the major ampullate spidroin 1 (MaSp 1). A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data. Our results can contribute to the design of new mutants with specific association properties. "

The CG simulations with explicit lipid and water capture bilayer penetration and pore formation, showing that pore formation is enhanced at high dendrimer concentration, but suppressed at low temperature and high salt concentration, in agreement with experiments. Cationic linear polymers have also been simulated, but do not perforate membranes, evidently because by deforming into a pancake, the charges on a linear polymer achieve intimate contact with a single bilayer leaflet. The relatively rigid dendrimers, on the other hand, penetrate the bilayer, because only by interacting with both leaflets can they achieve a similar degree of contact between charged groups. Also, a \"dendrimer-filled vesicle\" structure for the dendrimer-membrane interaction is predicted by mesoscale thermodynamic simulations, in agreement with a picture derived from experimental observations. In simulations of complexes of dendrimer and polyelectrolyte, anionic linear chains wrap around the cationic dendrimer and penetrate inside it.

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm.

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

NO is kept stable for long periods of time by binding it as an axial ligand to a ferriheme center. The fact that the nitrophorins are stabilized as Fe(III)-NO proteins is a unique property because most heme proteins are readily autoreduced by excess NO and bind NO to the Fe(II) heme irreversibly (K(d)s in the picomolar range). In contrast, the nitrophorins, as Fe(III) heme centers, have K(d)s in the micromolar to nanomolar range and thus allow NO to dissociate upon dilution following injection into the tissues of the victim. This NO can cause vasodilation and thereby allow more blood to be transported to the site of the wound. We prepared 13 site-directed mutants of three major nitrophorins, NP2, NP1, and NP4, to investigate the stabilization of the ferric-NO heme center and preservation of reversible binding that facilitates these proteins' NO storage, transport, and release functions. Of the mutations in which Glu and/or Asp were replaced by Ala, most of these carboxyls show a significant role stabilizing Fe(III)-NO over Fe(II)-NO, with buried E53 of NP2 or E55 of NP1 and NP4 being the most important and partially buried D29 of NP2 or D30 of NP4 being second in importance.

To assess the relevance of these findings for physiological binding, we also performed flash photolysis experiments on HbICO at room temperature and equilibrium binding studies with dioxygen. Our results show that the Xe4 and Xe2 cavities serve as transient docking sites for unbound ligands in the protein, but not as way stations on the entry/exit pathway.

Polarized absorption spectra indicate that oxidized and reduced hemes are reversibly formed. Exposure of the reduced form of enzyme crystals to carbon monoxide led to the complete release of the heme moiety. This process, which takes place reversibly and without apparent crystal damage, facilitates the preparation of a heme-free human enzyme. The heme-free enzyme crystals exhibited polarized absorption spectra typical of a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent protein. The exposure of these crystals to increasing concentrations of the natural substrate l-serine readily led to the formation of the key catalytic intermediate alpha-aminoacrylate. The dissociation constant of l-serine was found to be 6 mm, close to that determined in solution. The amount of the alpha-aminoacrylate Schiff base formed in the presence of l-serine was pH independent between 6 and 9. However, the rate of the disappearance of the alpha-aminoacrylate, likely forming pyruvate and ammonia, was found to increase at pH values higher than 8. Finally, in the presence of homocysteine the alpha-aminoacrylate-enzyme absorption band readily disappears with the concomitant formation of the absorption band of the internal aldimine, indicating that cystathionine beta-synthase crystals catalyze both beta-elimination and beta-replacement reactions.

Surface plasmon resonance measurements of annexin I, V, and mutants, which allowed evaluation of membrane aggregation activity of annexin I separately from its membrane binding, revealed direct correlation between the relative membrane aggregation activity and the relative affinity of the secondary interaction site for the secondary membrane.

This conjugate is a semisynthetic enzyme having NADH oxidase activity; the ethylphenazine moiety works as a catalytic group, and the coenzyme-binding site of glutamate dehydrogenase works as a substrate-binding site. The effects of the presence of the substrate-binding site near the catalytic group were studied by using EP(+)-PEG-GluDH. Before the preparation of the conjugate, the reactivity of NADH bound in the coenzyme-binding site toward the ethylphenazine moiety was estimated for glutamate and lactate dehydrogenases.

Therefore, glutamate dehydrogenase was used as the substrate-binding site of the semisynthetic NADH oxidase. The results of the kinetic analysis of the activity of EP(+)-PEG-GluDH show that the apparent turnover number of the active site is 0.38 s-1, which corresponds to the apparent intramolecular rate constant of the oxidation of NADH bound in the active site. The apparent effective concentration of bound NADH for the catalytic group of the ethylphenazine moiety is 0.33 mM. This means that the presence of the substrate-binding site near the catalytic group increases the local NADH concentration by at most 0.33 mM, and this is the rate-accelerating effect of the binding site."

About 70% of the phosphodiesterase activity found in rod outer segments is membrane-bound, and is thought to be anchored to the membrane through C-terminal prenyl groups. The recombinant delta subunit has been shown to solubilize the membrane-bound form of the enzyme. This paper describes the site and mechanism of this interaction in more detail. In isolated rod outer segments, the delta subunit was found exclusively in the soluble fraction, and about 30% of it did not coimmunoprecipitate with the catalytic subunits. The delta subunit that was bound to the catalytic subunits dissociated slowly, with a half-life of about 3.5 h. To determine whether the site of this strong binding was the C-termini of the phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits, peptides corresponding to the C-terminal ends of the alpha and beta subunits were synthesized. Micromolar concentrations of these peptides blocked the phosphodiesterase/delta subunit interaction. Interestingly, this blockade only occurred if the peptides were both prenylated and methylated. These results suggested that a major site of interaction of the delta subunit is the methylated, prenylated C-terminus of the phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits. To determine whether the catalytic subunits of the full-length enzyme are methylated in situ when bound to the delta subunit, we labeled rod outer segments with a tritiated methyl donor. Soluble phosphodiesterase from these rod outer segments was more highly methylated (4.5 +/- 0.3-fold) than the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase, suggesting that the delta subunit bound preferentially to the methylated enzyme in the outer segment. Together these results suggest that the delta subunit/phosphodiesterase catalytic subunit interaction may be regulated by the C-terminal methylation of the catalytic subunits."

Using the high-resolution crystal structure of cPLA2-C2 as a starting point, we embedded two copies of the C2 domain into a pre-equilibrated membrane at the depth and orientation previously defined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Noting that in the membrane-bound state the three calcium binding loops are complexed to two calcium ions, we initially restrained the calcium ions at the membrane depth determined by EPR. But the depth and orientation of the domains remained within EPR experimental errors when the restraints were later removed. We find that the thermally disordered, chemically heterogeneous interfacial zones of phosphatidylcholine bilayers allow local lipid remodeling to produce a nearly perfect match to the shape and polarity of the C2 domain, thereby enabling the C2 domain to assemble and optimize its own lipid docking site. The result is a cuplike docking site with a hydrophobic bottom and hydrophilic rim. Contrary to expectations, we did not find direct interactions between the protein-bound calcium ions and lipid headgroups, which were sterically excluded from the calcium binding cleft. Rather, the lipid phosphate groups provided outer-sphere calcium coordination through intervening water molecules. These results show that the combined use of high-resolution protein structures, EPR measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations provides a general approach for analyzing the molecular interactions between membrane-docked proteins and lipid bilayers."

Genetic complementation of Escherichia coli mutants unable to transport potassium suggests that TM1088A/B is part of a functional Trk potassium transporter complex with the membrane protein TM1089. The protein structure for TM1088A shows a characteristic Rossmann fold indicating an NAD+ binding site and has structural similarity to potassium channel-related proteins. Ligand binding studies indicated that ATP, ADP, and AMP stabilized TM1088A to a much greater degree than NADH and NAD, consistent with the crystal structure of TM1088A, which contains a bound AMP natural ligand at the characteristic GXGXXG nucleotide binding site. Mutation of single and all glycines at this nucleotide binding site eliminated in vitro protein stabilization by the ligand, yet these mutated proteins could still functionally complement the E. coli potassium uptake mutants. We predict that this new two-subunit class of TrkA proteins is present in a number of organisms. A further subclass of the predicted two-subunit TrkA proteins lack an identifiable membrane-spanning subunit of the Trk K+ transporter. This class, as exemplified by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, did not complement E. coli potassium transport with the native E. coli TrkH; thus, it may require a novel TrkH-like protein for activity or provide an alternate function in vivo."

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family."

A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data.

Their interactions with lipid bilayers may be studied via coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. Understanding such interactions is important as monotopic enzymes frequently act on hydrophobic substrates, while X-ray structures rarely provide direct information about their interactions with membranes. CG-MD self-assembly simulations enable prediction of the orientation and depth of insertion into a lipid bilayer of a monotopic protein, and also of the interactions of individual protein residues with lipid molecules. The CG-MD method has been evaluated via comparison with extended (>30 ns) atomistic simulations of monoamine oxidase, revealing good agreement between the results of coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. CG-MD simulations have been applied to a set of 11 monotopic proteins for which three-dimensional structures are available. These proteins may be divided into two groups on the basis of the results of the simulations. One group consists of those proteins which are inserted into the lipid bilayer to a limited extent, interacting mainly at the phospholipid-water interface. The second group consists of those which are inserted more deeply into the bilayer. Those monotopic proteins which are inserted more deeply cause significant local perturbation of bilayer properties such as bilayer thickness. Deeper insertion seems to correlate with a greater number of basic residues in the \"foot\" whereby a monotopic protein interacts with the membrane."

The CG simulations with explicit lipid and water capture bilayer penetration and pore formation, showing that pore formation is enhanced at high dendrimer concentration, but suppressed at low temperature and high salt concentration, in agreement with experiments. Cationic linear polymers have also been simulated, but do not perforate membranes, evidently because by deforming into a pancake, the charges on a linear polymer achieve intimate contact with a single bilayer leaflet. The relatively rigid dendrimers, on the other hand, penetrate the bilayer, because only by interacting with both leaflets can they achieve a similar degree of contact between charged groups. Also, a \"dendrimer-filled vesicle\" structure for the dendrimer-membrane interaction is predicted by mesoscale thermodynamic simulations, in agreement with a picture derived from experimental observations. In simulations of complexes of dendrimer and polyelectrolyte, anionic linear chains wrap around the cationic dendrimer and penetrate inside it.

Bacillus pasteurii cytochrome c(553), characterized by a low reduction potential and by a low sequence homology with cytochromes from Gram-negative bacteria or eukaryotes, is a useful case study for understanding the structure-function relationships for this class of electron-transfer proteins. Diffraction data on a single crystal of cytochrome c(553) were obtained using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The structure was determined at 0.97-A resolution using ab initio phasing and independently at 1.70 A in an MAD experiment. In both experiments, the structure solution exploited the presence of a single Fe atom as anomalous scatterer in the protein. For the 0.97-A data, the phasing was based on a single data set. This is the most precise structure of a heme protein to date. The crystallized cytochrome c(553) contains only 71 of the 92 residues expected from the intact protein sequence, lacking the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. This feature is consistent with previous evidence that this tail, responsible for anchoring the protein to the cytoplasm membrane, is easily cleaved off during the purification procedure. The heme prosthetic group in B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is surrounded by three alpha-helices in a compact arrangement. The largely exposed c-type heme group features a His-Met axial coordination of the Fe(III) ion. The protein is characterized by a very asymmetric charge distribution, with the exposed heme edge located on a surface patch devoid of net charges. A structural search of a representative set of protein structures reveals that B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is most similar to Pseudomonas cytochromes c(551), followed by cytochromes c(6), Desulfovibrio cytochrome c(553), cytochromes c(552) from thermophiles, and cytochromes c from eukaryotes. Notwithstanding a low sequence homology, a structure-based alignment of these cytochromes shows conservation of three helical regions, with different additional secondary structure motifs characterizing each protein. In B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553), these motifs are represented by the shortest interhelix connecting fragments observed for this group of proteins.

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

Although the role of TorA in the reduction of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been clearly established, no direct evidence for TorC involvement has been presented. TorC belongs to the NirT/NapC c-type cytochrome family based on homologies of its N-terminal tetrahemic domain (TorC(N)) to the cytochromes of this family, but TorC contains a C-terminal extension (TorC(C)) with an additional heme-binding site. In this study, we show that both domains are required for the anaerobic bacterial growth with TMAO. The intact TorC protein and its two domains, TorC(N) and TorC(C), were produced independently and purified for a biochemical characterization. The reduced form of TorC exhibited visible absorption maxima at 552, 523, and 417 nm.

In agreement with these values, the in vitro reconstitution of electron transfer between TorC, TorC(N), or TorC(C) and TorA showed that only TorC and TorC(C) were capable of electron transfer to TorA. Surprisingly, interaction studies revealed that only TorC and TorC(N) strongly bind TorA.

Compared with wild-type, S1412D nNOS catalyzed faster cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction but displayed slower steady-state NO synthesis with greater uncoupling of NADPH oxidation. Paradoxically, the mutant had faster heme reduction, faster heme-NO complex formation, and greater heme-NO complex accumulation at steady state. To understand how these behaviors related to flavin and heme reduction rates, we utilized three soybean calmodulins (CaMs) that supported a range of slower flavin and heme reduction rates in mutant and wild-type nNOS. Reductase activity and two catalytic parameters (speed and amount of heme-NO complex formation) related directly to the speed of flavin and heme reduction. In contrast, steady-state NO synthesis increased, reached a plateau, and then fell at the highest rate of heme reduction that was obtained with S1412D nNOS + CaM. Substituting with soybean CaM slowed heme reduction and increased steady-state NO synthesis by the mutant. We conclude the following. 1) The S1412D mutation speeds electron transfer out of the reductase domain. 2) Faster heme reduction speeds intrinsic NO synthesis but diminishes NO release in the steady state. 3) Heme reduction displays an optimum regarding NO release during steady state. The unique behavior of S1412D nNOS reveals the importance of heme reduction rate in controlling steady-state activity and suggests that nNOS already has a near-optimal rate of heme reduction."

Strong response of the monooxygenase system in O. niloticus to water pollution was detected with both specific cytochrome P-450 content and EROD activity increasing sharply. The optical spectra of hemoglobin from B. cephalus and C. macropomum were analyzed and some differences in shape and relative extinction were observed compared to known hemoglobins."

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family."

Bacillus pasteurii cytochrome c(553), characterized by a low reduction potential and by a low sequence homology with cytochromes from Gram-negative bacteria or eukaryotes, is a useful case study for understanding the structure-function relationships for this class of electron-transfer proteins. Diffraction data on a single crystal of cytochrome c(553) were obtained using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The structure was determined at 0.97-A resolution using ab initio phasing and independently at 1.70 A in an MAD experiment. In both experiments, the structure solution exploited the presence of a single Fe atom as anomalous scatterer in the protein. For the 0.97-A data, the phasing was based on a single data set. This is the most precise structure of a heme protein to date. The crystallized cytochrome c(553) contains only 71 of the 92 residues expected from the intact protein sequence, lacking the first 21 amino acids at the N-terminus. This feature is consistent with previous evidence that this tail, responsible for anchoring the protein to the cytoplasm membrane, is easily cleaved off during the purification procedure. The heme prosthetic group in B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is surrounded by three alpha-helices in a compact arrangement. The largely exposed c-type heme group features a His-Met axial coordination of the Fe(III) ion. The protein is characterized by a very asymmetric charge distribution, with the exposed heme edge located on a surface patch devoid of net charges. A structural search of a representative set of protein structures reveals that B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553) is most similar to Pseudomonas cytochromes c(551), followed by cytochromes c(6), Desulfovibrio cytochrome c(553), cytochromes c(552) from thermophiles, and cytochromes c from eukaryotes. Notwithstanding a low sequence homology, a structure-based alignment of these cytochromes shows conservation of three helical regions, with different additional secondary structure motifs characterizing each protein. In B. pasteurii cytochrome c(553), these motifs are represented by the shortest interhelix connecting fragments observed for this group of proteins. The possible relationships between heme solvent accessibility and the electrochemical reduction potential are discussed."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

About 70% of the phosphodiesterase activity found in rod outer segments is membrane-bound, and is thought to be anchored to the membrane through C-terminal prenyl groups. The recombinant delta subunit has been shown to solubilize the membrane-bound form of the enzyme. This paper describes the site and mechanism of this interaction in more detail. In isolated rod outer segments, the delta subunit was found exclusively in the soluble fraction, and about 30% of it did not coimmunoprecipitate with the catalytic subunits. The delta subunit that was bound to the catalytic subunits dissociated slowly, with a half-life of about 3.5 h. To determine whether the site of this strong binding was the C-termini of the phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits, peptides corresponding to the C-terminal ends of the alpha and beta subunits were synthesized. Micromolar concentrations of these peptides blocked the phosphodiesterase/delta subunit interaction. Interestingly, this blockade only occurred if the peptides were both prenylated and methylated. These results suggested that a major site of interaction of the delta subunit is the methylated, prenylated C-terminus of the phosphodiesterase catalytic subunits. To determine whether the catalytic subunits of the full-length enzyme are methylated in situ when bound to the delta subunit, we labeled rod outer segments with a tritiated methyl donor. Soluble phosphodiesterase from these rod outer segments was more highly methylated (4.5 +/- 0.3-fold) than the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase, suggesting that the delta subunit bound preferentially to the methylated enzyme in the outer segment. Together these results suggest that the delta subunit/phosphodiesterase catalytic subunit interaction may be regulated by the C-terminal methylation of the catalytic subunits."

In this study, diffuse-transmission UV/Vis spectroscopy is used to investigate the in situ spectral reaction of Cr(VI) reduction by c-Cyts in intact Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cells under different incubation conditions. The reduced c-Cyts decreased transiently at the beginning and then recovered gradually over time. The Cr(VI) reduction rates decreased with increasing initial Cr(VI) concentrations, and Cr(III) was identified as a reduced product. The presence of Cr(III) substantially inhibited Cr(VI) reduction and the recovery of reduced c-Cyts, indicating that Cr(III) might inhibit cell growth. Cr(VI) reduction rates increased with increasing cell density. The highest Cr(VI) reduction rate and fastest recovery of c-Cyts were obtained at pH 7.0 and 30\u00b0C, with sodium lactate serving as an electron donor. The presence of O2 strongly inhibited Cr(VI) reduction, suggesting that O2 might compete with Cr(VI) as an electron acceptor in cells.

A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data.

Collagenases are matrix metalloproteinases that cleave the peptide bond at a specific position on fibrillar collagen. The collagenase Hemopexin-like (HPX) domain has been proposed to be responsible for substrate recognition, but the mechanism by which collagenases identify the cleavage site on fibrillar collagen is not clearly understood. In this study, Brownian dynamics simulations coupled with atomic-detail and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were performed to dock matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) on a collagen III\u03b11 triple helical peptide. We find that the HPX domain recognizes the collagen triple helix at a conserved R-X11-R motif C-terminal to the cleavage site to which the HPX domain of collagen is guided electrostatically. The binding of the HPX domain between the two arginine residues is energetically stabilized by hydrophobic contacts with collagen. From the simulations and analysis of the sequences and structural flexibility of collagen and collagenase, a mechanistic scheme by which MMP-1 can recognize and bind collagen for proteolysis is proposed.

Experimental measurements have shown that pH triggers the dimer formation of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the major ampullate spidroin 1 (MaSp 1). A coarse-grained model accounting for electrostatics, van der Waals and pH-dependent charge-fluctuation interactions, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, gave us a more comprehensive view of the NTD dimerization process. A detailed analysis of the electrostatic properties and free energy derivatives for the NTD homoassociation was carried out at different pH values and salt concentrations for the protein wild type and for several mutants. We observed an enhancement of dipole-dipole interactions at pH 6 due to the ionization of key amino acids, a process identified as the main driving force for dimerization. Analytical estimates based on the DVLO theory framework corroborate our findings. Molecular dynamics simulations using the OPEP coarse-grained force field for proteins show that the mutant E17Q is subject to larger structural fluctuations when compared to the wild type. Estimates of the association rate constants for this mutant were evaluated by the Debye-Smoluchowski theory and are in agreement with the experimental data when thermally relaxed structures are used instead of the crystallographic data. Our results can contribute to the design of new mutants with specific association properties. "

The measured strains are systematically coarse-grained by averaging them within subsystems (of size L(b)) of a system (of total size L) in the canonical ensemble. Using a simple finite size scaling theory we predict the behavior of the fluctuations <epsilon(ij)epsilon(kl)> as a function of L(b)/L and extract elastic constants of the system in the thermodynamic limit at nonzero temperature. Our method is simple to implement, efficient, and general enough to be able to handle a wide class of model systems, including those with singular potentials without any essential modification. We illustrate the technique by computing isothermal elastic constants of \"hard\" and \"soft\" disk triangular solids in two dimensions from Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. We compare our results with those from earlier simulations and theory."

And we found that Ala substitutions of Cys191 and Cys197 in loop 5/6 reduced heme content to a half of the wild-type level.

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family."

NO disrupts the His-Fe bond and binds in a novel mode to the proximal face of the heme, giving a 5-coordinate species. In contrast, CO binds 6-coordinate on the distal side. A second CO molecule, not bound to the heme, is located in the proximal pocket. Since the unusual spectroscopic properties of cytochromes c' are shared by soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), our findings have potential implications for the activation of sGC induced by the binding of NO or CO to the heme domain."

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

In this paper, we report the characterization of a protein, IhtB (iron heme transport; formerly designated Pga30), that is an outer membrane hemin-binding protein potentially involved in iron assimilation by P. gingivalis. IhtB was localized to the cell surface of P. gingivalis by Western blot analysis of a Sarkosyl-insoluble outer membrane preparation and by immunocytochemical staining of whole cells using IhtB peptide-specific antisera. The protein, released from the cell surface, was shown to bind to hemin using hemin-agarose. The growth of heme-limited, but not heme-replete, P. gingivalis cells was inhibited by preincubation with IhtB peptide-specific antisera. The ihtB gene was located between an open reading frame encoding a putative TonB-linked outer membrane receptor and three open reading frames that have sequence similarity to ATP binding cassette transport system operons in other bacteria. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of IhtB showed significant similarity to the Salmonella typhimurium protein CbiK, a cobalt chelatase that is structurally related to the ATP-independent family of ferrochelatases. Molecular modeling indicated that the IhtB amino acid sequence could be threaded onto the CbiK fold with the IhtB structural model containing the active-site residues critical for chelatase activity. These results suggest that IhtB is a peripheral outer membrane chelatase that may remove iron from heme prior to uptake by P. gingivalis."

This down-regulates activity and increases enzyme K(m,O(2)). To understand this process, we developed a 10-step kinetic model in which the ferric heme-NO enzyme forms as the immediate product of catalysis, and then partitions between NO dissociation versus reduction to a ferrous heme-NO complex. Rate constants used for the model were derived from recent literature or were determined here. Computer simulations of the model precisely described both pre-steady and steady-state features of nNOS catalysis, including NADPH consumption and NO production, buildup of a heme-NO complex, changes between pre-steady and steady-state rates, and the change in enzyme K(m,O(2)) in the presence or absence of NO synthesis. The model also correctly simulated the catalytic features of nNOS mutants W409F and W409Y, which are hyperactive and display less heme-NO complex formation in the steady state. Model simulations showed how the rate of heme reduction influences several features of nNOS catalysis, including populations of NO-bound versus NO-free enzyme in the steady state and the rate of NO synthesis. The simulation predicts that there is an optimum rate of heme reduction that is close to the measured rate in nNOS. Ratio between NADPH consumption and NO synthesis is also predicted to increase with faster heme reduction. Our kinetic model is an accurate and versatile tool for understanding catalytic behavior and will provide new perspectives on NOS regulation."

HDR catalyzes the two-electron reduction of coenzyme B-S-S-coenzyme M (CoB-S-S-CoM), the heterodisulfide product of the methyl-CoM reductase reaction, to free thiols, HS-CoB and HS-CoM. HDR from Methanosarcina thermophila contains two b-hemes and two [Fe(4)S(4)] clusters. The physiological electron donor for HDR appears to be methanophenazine (MPhen), a membrane-bound cofactor, which can be replaced by a water-soluble analog, 2-hydroxyphenazine (HPhen). This report describes the electron transfer pathway from reduced HPhen (HPhenH(2)) to CoB-S-S-CoM. Steady-state kinetic studies indicate a ping-pong mechanism for heterodisulfide reduction by HPhenH(2) with the following values: k(cat) = 74 s(-1) at 25 degrees C, K(m) (HPhenH(2)) = 92 microm, K(m) (CoB-S-S-CoM) = 144 microm. Rapid freeze-quench EPR and stopped-flow kinetic studies and inhibition experiments using CO and diphenylene iodonium indicate that only the low spin heme and the high potential FeS cluster are involved in CoB-S-S-CoM reduction by HPhenH(2). Fe-S cluster disruption by mersalyl acid inhibits heme reduction by HPhenH(2), suggesting that a 4Fe cluster is the initial electron acceptor from HPhenH(2). We propose the following electron transfer pathway: HPhenH(2) to the high potential 4Fe cluster, to the low potential heme, and finally, to CoB-S-S-CoM."

A stable protein-protein adduct is detected both in the presence and in the absence of heme. Structural information on the complexed form of HasA is obtained from chemical shift mapping and statistical analysis of the spectral fingerprint of the protein NMR spectra obtained under different conditions. This approach shows the following: (i) only three different conformations are possible for HasA in solution: one for the isolated apoprotein, one for the isolated holoprotein, and one for the complexed protein, that is independent of the presence of the heme; (ii) the structure of the hemophore in the complex resembles the open conformation of the apoprotein; (iii) the surface contact area between HasA and HasR is independent of the presence of the heme, involving loop L1, loop L2, and the beta2-beta6 strands; (iv) upon complex formation the heme group is transferred from holoHasA to HasR."
