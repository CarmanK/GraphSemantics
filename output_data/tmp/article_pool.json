DTT at a concentration of 4 mM was included in the homogenization/initial isolation and the high-salt (KCl) buffers used in the preparation of the SR fraction. The inclusion of DTT in the SR isolation media did not affect the total amount of SR protein isolated from ventricular tissue. However, SR isolated in the presence of DTT exhibited a significantly increased (p less than 0.05) rate of calcium transport at free calcium concentrations ranging from 0.1 microM up to 2.0 microM, and a 26% increase in the apparent affinity of the SR calcium transport system for CA2+. DTT included in the calcium-transport reaction medium did not significantly alter the rate of SR calcium transport in SR preparations isolated in the absence or presence of DTT. These results demonstrate that functionally important sulfhydryl groups of the SR calcium transport pump may be oxidized during the isolation of the membrane fraction and that such oxidation can be reduced by including DTT in the isolation buffers."

Humans contain an alternative route of HDL-CE clearance, namely through the transfer by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) to apolipoprotein B lipoproteins for subsequent uptake via the LDL receptor. In this study, we determined whether CETP can compensate for loss of adrenal SR-BI. Transgenic expression of human CETP (CETP Tg) in SR-BI knockout (KO) mice increased adrenal HDL-CE clearance from 33-58% of the control value. SR-BI KO/CETP Tg and SR-BI KO mice displayed adrenal hypertrophy due to equally high plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. Adrenal cholesterol levels and plasma corticosterone levels were 38-52% decreased in SR-BI KO mice with and without CETP expression. SR-BI KO/CETP Tg mice also failed to increase their corticosterone level after lipopolysaccharide challenge, leading to an identical >4-fold increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha response compared with controls. These data indicate that uptake of CE via other routes than SR-BI is not sufficient to generate the cholesterol pool needed for optimal adrenal steroidogenesis. In conclusion, we have shown that CETP-mediated transfer of HDL-CE is not able to reverse adrenal insufficiency in SR-BI knockout mice. Thus, SR-BI-mediated uptake of serum cholesterol is essential for optimal adrenal function."

SRP and SR with helix N1 truncations interact at nearly the RNA-catalyzed rate in the absence of RNA. NMR spectroscopy and analysis of GTPase activity show that helix N1 truncation in SR mimics the conformational switch caused by complex formation.

Rodent SCCVII cells and repair deficient, radiation sensitive cells (rodent XR-1, V-3, and human AT5BI) were most sensitive to SR 4233 under hypoxia with a lethal dose needed to kill 50% of cells (LD50) of less than 5 microM.

However, XR-1 and V-3 cells were more sensitive to SR 4233 than predicted by the metabolism rate.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the thyroid hormone analogue, 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), prevents abnormal Ca(2+)transport and expression of SR proteins associated with post-infarction heart failure. New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to circumflex artery ligation or sham operation, and to DITPA administration (3.75 mg/kg/day) or no treatment in a two-by-two factorial design. After 3 weeks, echo-Doppler and LV hemodynamic measurements were performed. From ventricular tissue, single myocyte shortening and relaxation were determined, and Ca(2+)transport was measured in homogenates and SR-enriched microsomes. Levels of mRNA and protein content were determined for the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB), cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR-2) and calsequestrin. The administration of DITPA improved LV contraction and relaxation and improved myocyte shortening in infarcted animals. The improvements in LV and myocyte function were associated with increases in V(max)for SR Ca(2+)transport in both homogenates and microsomes. Also, DITPA prevented the decrease in LV protein density for SERCA2a, PLB and RyR-2 post-infarction, without measurable changes in mRNA levels. The thyroid hormone analogue, DITPA, improves LV, myocyte and SR function in infarcted hearts and prevents the downregulation of SR proteins associated with post-infarction heart failure. The specific effects of DITPA on post-infarction SR Ca(2+)transport and the expression of SR proteins make this compound a potentially useful therapeutic agent for LV systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction."

To study aspects of the entire PSII life-cycle, mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful tool that can be used in conjunction with biochemical techniques. In this article, we present the MS-based approaches that are used to study PSII composition, dynamics, and structure, and review the information about the PSII life-cycle that has been gained by these methods. This information includes the composition of PSII subcomplexes, discovery of accessory PSII proteins, identification of post-translational modifications and quantification of their changes under various conditions, determination of the binding site of proteins not observed in PSII crystal structures, conformational changes that underlie PSII functions, and identification of water and oxygen channels within PSII.

The temperature dependences of these spectral changes have the potential to distinguish between changes caused by the excitonic interaction and temperature-dependent processes. We observed a conformational change in the PSII RC protein part and changes in the spatial positions of the PSII RC pigments of the active D1 branch upon reduction of Pheo-D1 only in the case of high temperature (298 K) dynamics. The resulting absorption difference spectra of PSII RC models equilibrated at temperatures of 77 K and 298 K were highly consistent with our previous experiments in which light-induced bleaching of the PSII RC absorbance spectrum was observable only at 298 K. These results support our previous hypothesis that Pheo-D1 does not interact excitonically with the other chlorins of the PSII RC, since the reduced form of Pheo-D1 causes absorption spectra bleaching only due to temperature-dependent processes."

Although a potential target for crop improvement, the mechanism of PSII repair remains unclear. The D1 reaction center protein is the main target for photodamage(2), with repair involving the selective degradation of the damaged protein by FtsH protease(3). How a single damaged PSII subunit is recognized for replacement is unknown. Here, we have tested the dark stability of PSII subunits in strains of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 blocked at specific stages of assembly. We have found that when D1, which is normally shielded by the CP43 subunit, becomes exposed in a photochemically active PSII complex lacking CP43, it is selectively degraded by FtsH even in the dark. Removal of the CP47 subunit, which increases accessibility of FtsH to the D2 subunit, induced dark degradation of D2 at a faster rate than that of D1. In contrast, CP47 and CP43 are resistant to degradation in the dark. Our results indicate that protease accessibility induced by PSII disassembly is an important determinant in the selection of the D1 and D2 subunits to be degraded by FtsH. "

We propose that at low excitation rates back electron flow and charge recombination between the QB*- or QA*- semiquinone acceptors and the oxidized S(2,3) states of the PSII donor side may cause oxidative damage via generation of active oxygen species. Therefore, damage per photochemical event should increase with decreasing rates of PSII excitation. To test this hypothesis, the effect of the dark interval between single turnover flashes on the inactivation of water oxidation, charge separation and recombination, and the degradation of D1 protein were determined in spinach thylakoids. PSII inactivation per flash increases as the dark interval between the flashes increases, and a plateau is reached at dark intervals, allowing complete charge recombination of the QB*-/S2,3 or QA*-/S2 states (about 200 and 40 s, respectively). At these excitation rates: (i) 0.7% and 0.4% of PSII is inactivated and 0.4% and 0.2% of the D1 protein is degraded per flash, respectively, and (ii) the damage per flash is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that induced by equal amount of energy delivered by excess continuous light. No PSII damage occurs if flashes are given in anaerobic conditions. These results demonstrate that charge recombination in active PSII is promoted by low rates of excitation and may account for a the high quantum efficiency of the rapid turnover of the D1 protein induced by limiting light."

It is based on the accurate determination of the so-called Fm('), i.e. the fluorescence signal emitted when a \"saturating\" light pulse closes all PSII centers. In this methodological investigation, we examined whether the saturating pulse intensities required to obtain maximal fluorescence yields differ between leaves of various species receiving varying actinic light irradiances. It was shown that, in leaves adapted to comparatively high (yet realistic) levels of natural irradiances, the saturating pulses usually applied are not able to close all PSII reaction centers. As a result, there is a high risk of considerable Fm(') underestimation. Accordingly, the derived values of effective PSII yields and linear electron transport rates (ETR) are also underestimated, even at the highest saturation pulse levels afforded by commercial instruments. Since the extent of underestimation increases with actinic irradiance, the ETR versus light curves are considerably distorted. The possible reasons for the apparent inability of \"saturating\" pulses to close all PSII centers at high actinic light and the practical implications, especially in field work, are discussed."

Measurements of Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I activity by Clark-type oxygen electrode demonstrated that electron flow is impaired primarily in PSII. The site and mechanism of UV-A induced damage within PSII was assessed by flash-induced oxygen and thermoluminescence (TL) measurements. The flash pattern of oxygen evolution showed an increased amount of the S0 state in the dark, which indicate a direct effect of UV-A in the water-oxidizing complex. TL measurements revealed the UV-A induced loss of PSII centers in which charge recombination between the S2 state of the water oxidizing complex and the semireduced Q(A)- and Q(B)- quinone electron acceptors occur. Flash-induced oscillation of the B TL band, originating from the S2Q(B)- recombination, showed a decreased amplitude after the second flash relative to that after the first one, which is consistent with a decrease in the amount of Q(B)- relative to Q(B) in dark adapted samples. The efficiency of UV-A light in inhibiting PSII electron transport exceeds that of visible light 45-fold on the basis of equal energy and 60-fold on the basis of equal photon number, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that UV-A radiation is highly damaging for PSII, whose electron transport is affected both at the water oxidizing complex, and the binding site of the Q(B) quinone electron acceptor in a similar way to that caused by UV-B radiation."

The permanent presence of PBS-specific peaks in the in situ action spectra of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), as well as in the 77 K fluorescence excitation spectra for chlorophyll emission at 690 nm (PSII) and 725 nm (PSI) showed that PBS are constitutive antenna complexes of both photosystems.

The detectable changes of energy migration from PBS to the PSI and PSII in the Synechocystis wild type and the CK mutant in State 1 and State 2 according to the fluorescence excitation spectra measurements were not registered. The constant level of fluorescence emission of PSI during State 1/State 2 transitions and simultaneous increase of chlorophyll fluorescence emission of PSII in State 1 in Synechocystis PAL mutant allowed to propose that spillover is an unlikely mechanism of state transitions. Blue-green light absorbed by OCP diminished the rout of energy from PBS to PSI while energy migration from PBS to PSII was less influenced.

In buffered solutions equilibrated with the atmosphere (nondepleted of bicarbonate), the bicarbonate effect is observed only at pH lower than the pK of H2CO3 dissociation (6.4), which indicates that HCO3- is the essential species for the restoration effect. The addition of just 2 Mn2+ atoms per one PSII reaction center is enough for the maximal reactivation when bicarbonate is present in the medium.

The rationale for this reanalysis is that at least one short-lived component could not be described in the previous simpler models. This new analysis supports the involvement of a protein relaxation step for open RCs as well. In this model the rate of ET from reduced pheophytin to the primary quinone Q(A) is determined to be 4.1 ns(-1). The rate of initial charge separation is slowed down substantially from approximately 170 ns(-1) in PSII with open RCs to 56 ns(-1) upon reduction of Q(A). However, the free-energy drop of the first RP is not changed substantially between the two RC redox states. The currently assumed mechanistic model, assuming the same early RP intermediates in both states of RC, is inconsistent with the presented energetics of the RPs.

The effects produced by purified endo-xylanases from two different glycosyl hydrolase families (family 10 and 11) as well as acetyl xylan esterases were examined and assessed on pulp in relation to their bleaching abilities. The purified endo-xylanases hydrolyzed only a limited portion (less than 30%) of the acetylglucuronoxylan present in the pulp. The enzymes of family 10 produced acetylated xylobiose and xylotriose whereas acetylated xylobiose was not observed among the products released from the pulp by the family 11 xylanases. The esterases however were not capable of deacetylating the acetylated aldouronic acids generated by the xylanases.

Its balanced sugar (cellobiose, lactose, mannitol, and trehalose) and protein (beef extract and polypeptone peptone) formulation provided Salmonella with a selective growth advantage over non-Salmonella enteric organisms. The formulations promoted the production and detection of H2S production levels that otherwise might be missed with traditional agar formulations. In combination, these advantages contributed to increased sensitivity without the loss of specificity. In comparative studies using 86 samples of meat products (beef, pork, and chicken), the new media, Miller-Mallinson (MM) agar and xylose lysine tergitol (Niaproof) 4 agar, possessed significantly higher sensitivity (P < 0.001) and an improved specificity over bismuth sulfite, hektoen enteric, and xylose lysine desoxycholate agars. However, these samples did not contain nontyphoid salmonellae with weak to ultraweak H2S production characteristics. Modified formulations of MM agar were generally similar to bismuth sulfite and hektoen enteric agars in the identification of four of seven globally diverse strains of Salmonella serotype Typhi. Two of these seven strains were found to produce more readily identifiable black (H2S-positive) colonies on MM agar, whereas one of the seven was not readily detected by any of the media. The improved detection of nontyphoid and typhoid salmonellae attests to the sensitivity of MM agar and to its potentially broad utility in both clinical and food quality laboratories."

For example, Arabidopsis thaliana contains thirteen 14-3-3 genes, each of which is expressed.

As the field progresses, it is essential to understand these proteins' activities at both the spatiotemporal and subcellular levels. This review summarizes current knowledge of 14-3-3 proteins in plants, including 14-3-3 interactions, regulatory functions, isoform specificity, and post-translational modifications. We begin with a historical overview and structural analysis of 14-3-3 proteins, which describes the basic principles of 14-3-3 function, and then discuss interactions and regulatory effects of plant 14-3-3 proteins in specific tissues and subcellular compartments. We conclude with a summary of 14-3-3 phosphorylation and current knowledge of the functional effects of this modification in plants. "

Overexpression of 14-3-3 beta in NIH 3T3 cells stimulated cell growth and supported anchorage-independent growth in soft agar medium and tumor formation in nude mice. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of 14-3-3 beta-mediated NIH 3T3 transformation, we examined the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) after serum stimulation. Overexpression of 14-3-3 beta augmented MAPK activity after serum stimulation, and MAPK activity correlated well with the amount of 14-3-3 beta expression. The colony-forming ability of NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing 14-3-3 beta in soft agar medium was efficiently abolished by exogenous expression of a dominant-negative mutant of MEK1 and 14-3-3 beta physically interacted with Raf-1 in these cells.

The expression level of all these proteins markedly decreased in relation with the apoptosis progression and all isoforms underwent truncation, which probably corresponds to the removal of several C-terminal amino acids.

In addition to caspases, a non-caspase protease is likely to contribute to 14-3-3's cleavage in an isoform-specific manner. While 14-3-3 gamma seems to be cleaved mainly by caspase-3, the alternative mechanism is essentially involved in the case of 14-3-3 tau, and a combined effect was observed for the isoforms epsilon, beta, and zeta.

The source of Ca(2+) for the Ca(2+)-dependent exocytotic release of glutamate from astrocytes predominately comes from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores with contributions from both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- and ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive stores. An additional source of Ca(2+) comes from the extracellular space via store-operated Ca(2+) entry due to the depletion of ER stores. Here transient receptor potential canonical type 1 containing channels permit entry of Ca(2+) to the cytosol, which can then be transported by the store-specific Ca(2+)-ATPase to (re)fill ER. Mitochondria can modulate cytosolic Ca(2+) levels by affecting two aspects of the cytosolic Ca(2+) kinetics in astrocytes. They play a role in immediate sequestration of Ca(2+) during the cytosolic Ca(2+) increase in stimulated astrocytes as a result of Ca(2+) entry into the cytosol from ER stores and/or extracellular space. As cytosolic Ca(2+)declines due to activity of pumps, such as the smooth ER Ca(2+)-ATPase, free Ca(2+) is slowly released by mitochondria into cytosol. Taken together, the trinity of Ca(2+) sources, ER, extracellular space and mitochondria, can vary concentration of cytosolic Ca(2+) which in turn can modulate Ca(2+)-dependent vesicular glutamate release from astrocytes. An understanding of how these Ca(2+) sources contribute to glutamate release in (patho)physiology of astrocytes will provide information on astrocytic functions in health and disease and may also open opportunities for medical intervention."

However, no quantitative data exists regarding (1) Ca(2+) dependence of DADs, (2) Ca(2+) required to depolarize the cell to threshold and trigger an action potential (AP), or (3) relative contributions of Ca(2+)-activated currents to DADs. To address these points, we evoked SR Ca(2+) release by rapid application of caffeine in indo 1-AM-loaded rabbit ventricular myocytes and measured caffeine-induced DADs (cDADs) with whole-cell current clamp. The SR Ca(2+) load of the myocyte was varied by different AP frequencies. The cDAD amplitude doubled for every 88+/-8 nmol/L of Delta[Ca(2+)](i) (simple exponential), and the Delta[Ca(2+)](i) threshold of 424+/-58 nmol/L was sufficient to trigger an AP. Blocking Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange current (I(Na/Ca)) by removal of [Na](o) and [Ca(2+)](o) (or with 5 mmol/L Ni(2+)) reduced cDADs by >90%, for the same Delta[Ca(2+)](i). In contrast, blockade of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (I(Cl(Ca))) with 50 micromol/L niflumate did not significantly alter cDADs. We conclude that DADs are almost entirely due to I(Na/Ca), not I(Cl(Ca)) or Ca(2+)-activated nonselective cation current. To trigger an AP requires 30 to 40 micromol/L cytosolic Ca(2+) or a [Ca(2+)](i) transient of 424 nmol/L. Current injection, simulating I(ti)s with different time courses, revealed that faster I:(ti)s require less charge for AP triggering. Given that spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release occurs in waves, which are slower than cDADs or fast I(ti)s, the true Delta[Ca(2+)](i) threshold for AP activation may be approximately 3-fold higher in normal myocytes. This provides a safety margin against arrhythmia in normal ventricular myocytes."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of daily intakes of Ca supplements on Ca balance during hypokinesia (HK). Studies were done during 30 d of a pre-HK period and during 364 d of a HK period. Forty male athletes aged 23-26 yr were chosen as subjects. They were divided equally into four groups: unsupplemented ambulatory control subjects (UACS), unsupplemented hypokinetic subjects (UHKS), supplemented hypokinetic subjects (SHKS), and supplemented ambulatory control subjects (SACS). The SHKS and UHKS groups were kept under an average running distance of 0.7 km/d. In the SHKS and SACS groups supplemented with 35.0 mg Ca lactate/kg body weight. Fecal Ca loss, urinary excretion of Ca and phosphate (P), serum concentrations of ionized calcium (CaI) total Ca, P, and Ca balance, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), anthropometric characteristics and peak oxygen uptake were measured. Fecal Ca excretion, urinary Ca and P excretion, serum CaI, total Ca, and P concentration, and negative Ca balanced increased significantly (p < or = 0.01) in the SHKS and UHKS groups when compared with the SACS and UACS groups. Serum, urinary, and fecal Ca changes were much greater and appeared much faster in the SHKS group than in the UHKS group. Serum iPTH and 1,25 (OH)2 D, body weight, and peak oxygen uptake decreased significantly (p < or = 0.01) in the SHKS and UHKS groups when compared with the SACS and UACS groups. In contrast, the corresponding parameters remained stable in the SACS and UACS groups when compared with the baseline control values. It was concluded that during prolonged HK, urinary and fecal Ca excretion and serum Ca concentration increased significantly despite the presence of a negative Ca balance; thus, Ca supplements cannot be used to normalize negative Ca balance during prolonged HK."

High luminal Ca(2+) sensitizes RyR2, thereby increasing Ca(2+) sparks frequency, and the larger RyR2-mediated SR Ca(2+) flux (dF/dt) sequentially activates adjacent RyR2 clusters. Recently, it was proposed that rapid SERCA Ca(2+) reuptake, ahead of the wave front, further sensitizes RyR2, increasing \u028bwave. Nevertheless, this is controversial because rapid cytosolic Ca(2+) removal could instead impair RyR2 activation. We assessed whether rapid SR Ca(2+) uptake enhances \u028bwave by changing SERCA activity (\u04a1Decay) over a large range (\u223c175%). We used normal (Ctrl) and hyperthyroid rat (HT; reduced phospholamban by \u223c80%) myocytes treated with thapsigargin or isoproterenol (ISO). We found that \u028bwave and dF/dt had a non-linear dependency with \u04a1Decay, while Ca(2+) waves amplitude was largely unaffected. Furthermore, SR Ca(2+) also showed a non-linear dependency with \u04a1Decay, however, the relationships \u028bwave vs. SR Ca(2+) and \u028bwave vs. dF/dt were linear, suggesting that high steady state SR Ca(2+) determines \u028bwave, while rapid SERCA Ca(2+) uptake does not. Finally, ISO did not increase \u028bwave in HT cells, therefore, ISO-enhanced \u028bwave in Ctrl depended on high SR Ca(2+). "

Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) reduced ET-1-induced tension; however, nifedipine had only a slight effect. These data indicate that maintenance of resting [Ca(2+)](i) in PASMCs from chronically hypoxic rats does not require activation of L-type Ca(2+) channels and suggest that ET-1-induced contraction occurs by a mechanism primarily independent of changes in [Ca(2+)](i)."

The shift of the characteristic IR band of the PT ring and the emergence of two charge transfer bands at 254nm and 246nm in UV difference spectra show the presence of pi-pi complexation between folic acid and anthracene.

Current strength susceptibilities have been obtained by numerically integrating separately the diatropic and paratropic contributions to the current flow passing planes through chosen bonds of the molecules. The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2. The calculated current patterns elucidate why the compounds with formally [4n + 2] \u03c0-electrons have unusual aromatic properties violating the H\u00fcckel \u03c0-electron count rule.

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine their affinity and selectivity are correspondingly important. Herein, we have determined the relative strengths of intramolecular interactions between a series of monosaccharides and an aromatic ring close to the glycosylation site in an N-glycoprotein host. We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars. Galactose seems to make the weakest and allose the strongest sugar-aromatic interactions, with glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in between. The NMR solution structures of several of the monosaccharide-containing N-glycoproteins were solved to further understand the origins of the similarities and differences between the monosaccharide-aromatic interaction energies. Peracetylation of the monosaccharides substantially increases the strength of the sugar-aromatic interaction in the context of our N-glycoprotein host. Finally, we discuss our results in light of recent literature regarding the contribution of electrostatics to CH-\u03c0 interactions and speculate on what our observations imply about the absolute conservation of GlcNAc as the monosaccharide through which N-linked glycans are attached to glycoproteins in eukaryotes.

These occur both within repeating elements of secondary structure and in tertiary and quaternary interactions. It has been suggested that they are important in protein folding and stability, and non-bonded potential energy calculations indicate that a typical aromatic-aromatic interaction has an energy of between -1 and -2 kcal/mol and contributes between -0.6 and -1.3 kcal/mol to protein stability. There is such an aromatic pair on the solvent-exposed face of the first alpha-helix of barnase, the small ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The edge of the aromatic ring of Tyr17 interacts with the face of that of Tyr13. The two residues have been mutated both singly and pairwise to alanine, and their free energies of unfolding determined by denaturation with urea. Application of the double-mutant cycle analysis gives an interaction energy of -1.3 kcal/mol for the aromatic pair in the folded protein relative to solvation by water in the unfolded protein. This value is similar to that calculated from the change in surface-accessible area between the rings on the formation of the pair. Analysis of a further double-mutant cycle in which the Tyr residues are mutated to Phe indicates that the aromatic-aromatic interactions of Tyr/Tyr and Phe/Phe make identical contributions to protein stability. However, Tyr is preferred to Phe by 0.3(+/- 0.04) kcal/mol at the solvent-exposed face of the alpha-helix."

It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions.

In the 0-2 cm layer, 2/3 of the mineralization could be attributed to sulfate reduction and 1/3 to iron reduction. In the 5-9 cm layer, sulfate reduction was the sole mineralization process. Acetate and lactate turnover rates were measured by radiotracer. Inhibition of sulfate reduction with selenate resulted in the accumulation of acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate. The acetate turnover rates determined by radiotracer and accumulation after inhibition were similar. VFA turnover accounted for 21% and 52% of the mineralization through sulfate reduction in the 0-2 and 5-9 cm layer, respectively. Acetate and lactate turnover in the inhibited 0-2 cm slurry was attributed to iron reduction and accounted for 10% and 2% of the iron reduction. Therefore, 88% and 79% of the iron and sulfate reduction in the 0-2 cm layer, respectively, must be fueled by alternative e(-)-donors. The accumulation of VFA in the selenate-inhibited 0-2 cm slurry did not enhance iron reduction, indicating that iron reducers were not limited by VFA availability."

Few patients present for revisional procedures, and even fewer present for a secondary or repeated reduction mammaplasty. This study defines secondary reduction mammaplasty as performing an additional reduction using a pedicled nipple-areola complex. Few reports of secondary reduction are found in the literature. Operative guidelines for secondary reduction mammaplasty have been published recently. However, the experience of others has differed from these guidelines, and herein is presented another experience with secondary reduction mammaplasty. Ten cases of secondary reduction over a 37-year period were identified and reviewed. The initial reductions were performed using six different techniques. An average of 307 g of tissue per breast (range, 130 to 552 g) was removed at the initial operations. The secondary reductions were performed using four different techniques, and an average of 458 g of tissue per breast (range, 147 to 700 g) was removed at the secondary operations. Three of the 10 patients underwent initial and secondary reduction with the same technique. An average of 4 years (range, 1 to 10 years) separated these surgeries. Seven of the 10 patients underwent initial and secondary reductions with different technique. An average of 15 years (range, 5 to 19 years) separated these procedures. There was an average 5-year follow-up (range, 1 to 20 years) in this series. Four of the 10 patients experienced self-limiting complications after secondary reduction, including delay in wound healing, delay in the return of nipple sensitivity, and mild fat necrosis. Three of the four patients with complications had undergone secondary reduction with a different pedicle technique. No significant or long-lasting skin, pedicle, or nipple-areola complex compromise was found after secondary reduction mammaplasty. In contrast to the recently published guidelines, this study demonstrates that secondary reduction mammaplasty is a safe and viable option when performed with either similar or different technique. This finding allows secondary reduction mammaplasty to be tailored to the individual breast type and to the abilities of the specific surgeon."

We mutated a target residue in that site (Ser-1412 to Asp) to mimic phosphorylation and then characterized the mutant using conventional and stopped-flow spectroscopies. Compared with wild-type, S1412D nNOS catalyzed faster cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction but displayed slower steady-state NO synthesis with greater uncoupling of NADPH oxidation. Paradoxically, the mutant had faster heme reduction, faster heme-NO complex formation, and greater heme-NO complex accumulation at steady state. To understand how these behaviors related to flavin and heme reduction rates, we utilized three soybean calmodulins (CaMs) that supported a range of slower flavin and heme reduction rates in mutant and wild-type nNOS. Reductase activity and two catalytic parameters (speed and amount of heme-NO complex formation) related directly to the speed of flavin and heme reduction. In contrast, steady-state NO synthesis increased, reached a plateau, and then fell at the highest rate of heme reduction that was obtained with S1412D nNOS + CaM. Substituting with soybean CaM slowed heme reduction and increased steady-state NO synthesis by the mutant. We conclude the following. 1) The S1412D mutation speeds electron transfer out of the reductase domain. 2) Faster heme reduction speeds intrinsic NO synthesis but diminishes NO release in the steady state. 3) Heme reduction displays an optimum regarding NO release during steady state. The unique behavior of S1412D nNOS reveals the importance of heme reduction rate in controlling steady-state activity and suggests that nNOS already has a near-optimal rate of heme reduction."

In this study, diffuse-transmission UV/Vis spectroscopy is used to investigate the in situ spectral reaction of Cr(VI) reduction by c-Cyts in intact Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cells under different incubation conditions. The reduced c-Cyts decreased transiently at the beginning and then recovered gradually over time. The Cr(VI) reduction rates decreased with increasing initial Cr(VI) concentrations, and Cr(III) was identified as a reduced product. The presence of Cr(III) substantially inhibited Cr(VI) reduction and the recovery of reduced c-Cyts, indicating that Cr(III) might inhibit cell growth. Cr(VI) reduction rates increased with increasing cell density. The highest Cr(VI) reduction rate and fastest recovery of c-Cyts were obtained at pH 7.0 and 30\u00b0C, with sodium lactate serving as an electron donor. The presence of O2 strongly inhibited Cr(VI) reduction, suggesting that O2 might compete with Cr(VI) as an electron acceptor in cells. This study provides a case of directly examining in vivo reaction properties of an outer-membrane enzyme during microbial metal reduction processes under non-invasive physiological conditions. "

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure."

The resulting absorption difference spectra of PSII RC models equilibrated at temperatures of 77 K and 298 K were highly consistent with our previous experiments in which light-induced bleaching of the PSII RC absorbance spectrum was observable only at 298 K.

The D1 reaction center protein is the main target for photodamage(2), with repair involving the selective degradation of the damaged protein by FtsH protease(3). How a single damaged PSII subunit is recognized for replacement is unknown. Here, we have tested the dark stability of PSII subunits in strains of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 blocked at specific stages of assembly. We have found that when D1, which is normally shielded by the CP43 subunit, becomes exposed in a photochemically active PSII complex lacking CP43, it is selectively degraded by FtsH even in the dark. Removal of the CP47 subunit, which increases accessibility of FtsH to the D2 subunit, induced dark degradation of D2 at a faster rate than that of D1. In contrast, CP47 and CP43 are resistant to degradation in the dark. Our results indicate that protease accessibility induced by PSII disassembly is an important determinant in the selection of the D1 and D2 subunits to be degraded by FtsH. "

We propose that at low excitation rates back electron flow and charge recombination between the QB*- or QA*- semiquinone acceptors and the oxidized S(2,3) states of the PSII donor side may cause oxidative damage via generation of active oxygen species. Therefore, damage per photochemical event should increase with decreasing rates of PSII excitation. To test this hypothesis, the effect of the dark interval between single turnover flashes on the inactivation of water oxidation, charge separation and recombination, and the degradation of D1 protein were determined in spinach thylakoids. PSII inactivation per flash increases as the dark interval between the flashes increases, and a plateau is reached at dark intervals, allowing complete charge recombination of the QB*-/S2,3 or QA*-/S2 states (about 200 and 40 s, respectively). At these excitation rates: (i) 0.7% and 0.4% of PSII is inactivated and 0.4% and 0.2% of the D1 protein is degraded per flash, respectively, and (ii) the damage per flash is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that induced by equal amount of energy delivered by excess continuous light. No PSII damage occurs if flashes are given in anaerobic conditions.

It is based on the accurate determination of the so-called Fm('), i.e. the fluorescence signal emitted when a \"saturating\" light pulse closes all PSII centers. In this methodological investigation, we examined whether the saturating pulse intensities required to obtain maximal fluorescence yields differ between leaves of various species receiving varying actinic light irradiances. It was shown that, in leaves adapted to comparatively high (yet realistic) levels of natural irradiances, the saturating pulses usually applied are not able to close all PSII reaction centers. As a result, there is a high risk of considerable Fm(') underestimation. Accordingly, the derived values of effective PSII yields and linear electron transport rates (ETR) are also underestimated, even at the highest saturation pulse levels afforded by commercial instruments. Since the extent of underestimation increases with actinic irradiance, the ETR versus light curves are considerably distorted. The possible reasons for the apparent inability of \"saturating\" pulses to close all PSII centers at high actinic light and the practical implications, especially in field work, are discussed."

Measurements of Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I activity by Clark-type oxygen electrode demonstrated that electron flow is impaired primarily in PSII. The site and mechanism of UV-A induced damage within PSII was assessed by flash-induced oxygen and thermoluminescence (TL) measurements. The flash pattern of oxygen evolution showed an increased amount of the S0 state in the dark, which indicate a direct effect of UV-A in the water-oxidizing complex. TL measurements revealed the UV-A induced loss of PSII centers in which charge recombination between the S2 state of the water oxidizing complex and the semireduced Q(A)- and Q(B)- quinone electron acceptors occur. Flash-induced oscillation of the B TL band, originating from the S2Q(B)- recombination, showed a decreased amplitude after the second flash relative to that after the first one, which is consistent with a decrease in the amount of Q(B)- relative to Q(B) in dark adapted samples. The efficiency of UV-A light in inhibiting PSII electron transport exceeds that of visible light 45-fold on the basis of equal energy and 60-fold on the basis of equal photon number, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that UV-A radiation is highly damaging for PSII, whose electron transport is affected both at the water oxidizing complex, and the binding site of the Q(B) quinone electron acceptor in a similar way to that caused by UV-B radiation."

PCC 6803 wild type, CK pigment mutant lacking phycocyanin, and PAL mutant totally devoid of phycobiliproteins. The permanent presence of PBS-specific peaks in the in situ action spectra of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), as well as in the 77 K fluorescence excitation spectra for chlorophyll emission at 690 nm (PSII) and 725 nm (PSI) showed that PBS are constitutive antenna complexes of both photosystems. The mutant strains compensated the lack of phycobiliproteins by higher PSII content and by intensification of photosynthetic linear electron transfer. The detectable changes of energy migration from PBS to the PSI and PSII in the Synechocystis wild type and the CK mutant in State 1 and State 2 according to the fluorescence excitation spectra measurements were not registered. The constant level of fluorescence emission of PSI during State 1/State 2 transitions and simultaneous increase of chlorophyll fluorescence emission of PSII in State 1 in Synechocystis PAL mutant allowed to propose that spillover is an unlikely mechanism of state transitions. Blue-green light absorbed by OCP diminished the rout of energy from PBS to PSI while energy migration from PBS to PSII was less influenced. Therefore, the main role of OCP-induced quenching of PBS is the limitation of PSI activity and cyclic electron transport under relatively high light conditions."

In buffered solutions equilibrated with the atmosphere (nondepleted of bicarbonate), the bicarbonate effect is observed only at pH lower than the pK of H2CO3 dissociation (6.4), which indicates that HCO3- is the essential species for the restoration effect. The addition of just 2 Mn2+ atoms per one PSII reaction center is enough for the maximal reactivation when bicarbonate is present in the medium. Analysis of bicarbonate concentration dependence of the restoration effect reveals two binding sites for bicarbonate with apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 2.5 microM and 20-34 microM when 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone is used as electron acceptor, while in the presence of silicomolybdate only the latter one remains. Similar bicarbonate concentration dependence of O2 evolution was obtained in untreated Mn-containing PSII membrane fragments. It is suggested that the Kd of 20-34 microM is associated with the donor side of PSII while the location of the lower Kd binding site is not quite clear. The conclusion is made that bicarbonate is an essential constituent of the water-oxidizing complex of PSII, important for its assembly and maintenance in the functionally active state."

The data are modeled in terms of electron transfer (ET) and associated protein conformational relaxation processes, resolving four different radical pair (RP) states. The target analyses reveal the importance of protein relaxation steps in the ET chain for the functioning of PSII. We also tested previously published data on cyanobacterial PSII with open RCs using models that involved protein relaxation steps as suggested by our data on closed RCs. The rationale for this reanalysis is that at least one short-lived component could not be described in the previous simpler models. This new analysis supports the involvement of a protein relaxation step for open RCs as well. In this model the rate of ET from reduced pheophytin to the primary quinone Q(A) is determined to be 4.1 ns(-1). The rate of initial charge separation is slowed down substantially from approximately 170 ns(-1) in PSII with open RCs to 56 ns(-1) upon reduction of Q(A). However, the free-energy drop of the first RP is not changed substantially between the two RC redox states. The currently assumed mechanistic model, assuming the same early RP intermediates in both states of RC, is inconsistent with the presented energetics of the RPs. Additionally, a comparison between PSII with closed RCs in isolated cores and in intact cells reveals slightly different relaxation kinetics, with a approximately 3.7 ns component present only in isolated cores."

The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA."

Humans contain an alternative route of HDL-CE clearance, namely through the transfer by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) to apolipoprotein B lipoproteins for subsequent uptake via the LDL receptor. In this study, we determined whether CETP can compensate for loss of adrenal SR-BI. Transgenic expression of human CETP (CETP Tg) in SR-BI knockout (KO) mice increased adrenal HDL-CE clearance from 33-58% of the control value. SR-BI KO/CETP Tg and SR-BI KO mice displayed adrenal hypertrophy due to equally high plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. Adrenal cholesterol levels and plasma corticosterone levels were 38-52% decreased in SR-BI KO mice with and without CETP expression. SR-BI KO/CETP Tg mice also failed to increase their corticosterone level after lipopolysaccharide challenge, leading to an identical >4-fold increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha response compared with controls. These data indicate that uptake of CE via other routes than SR-BI is not sufficient to generate the cholesterol pool needed for optimal adrenal steroidogenesis. In conclusion, we have shown that CETP-mediated transfer of HDL-CE is not able to reverse adrenal insufficiency in SR-BI knockout mice. Thus, SR-BI-mediated uptake of serum cholesterol is essential for optimal adrenal function."

SRP and SR with helix N1 truncations interact at nearly the RNA-catalyzed rate in the absence of RNA. NMR spectroscopy and analysis of GTPase activity show that helix N1 truncation in SR mimics the conformational switch caused by complex formation.

The \"male-sex-ratio\" (msr) phenotype is a modified form of sr in which SR/Y males produce a higher frequency of sterile X/O sons. The msr trait is due to the presence of the SR X-chromosome in males which are also homozygous for one or more autosomes from the L116 strain. Here the frequency of nullo-3 and diplo-3 sperm from msr males was measured by crossing to a compound-3 strain and found to be 13.8% and 3.2%, respectively, of the total viable sperm. The sr males produced very low levels of nullo-3 sperm at a frequency not different from control X/Y males and a slightly elevated frequency of diplo-3 sperm over X/Y males.

Microscopic studies of meiosis in testes from msr males indicates meiotic nondisjunction and meiotic chromosome loss are responsible for the msr phenotype.

New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to circumflex artery ligation or sham operation, and to DITPA administration (3.75 mg/kg/day) or no treatment in a two-by-two factorial design. After 3 weeks, echo-Doppler and LV hemodynamic measurements were performed.

Levels of mRNA and protein content were determined for the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB), cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR-2) and calsequestrin. The administration of DITPA improved LV contraction and relaxation and improved myocyte shortening in infarcted animals. The improvements in LV and myocyte function were associated with increases in V(max)for SR Ca(2+)transport in both homogenates and microsomes. Also, DITPA prevented the decrease in LV protein density for SERCA2a, PLB and RyR-2 post-infarction, without measurable changes in mRNA levels.

High luminal Ca(2+) sensitizes RyR2, thereby increasing Ca(2+) sparks frequency, and the larger RyR2-mediated SR Ca(2+) flux (dF/dt) sequentially activates adjacent RyR2 clusters. Recently, it was proposed that rapid SERCA Ca(2+) reuptake, ahead of the wave front, further sensitizes RyR2, increasing \u028bwave. Nevertheless, this is controversial because rapid cytosolic Ca(2+) removal could instead impair RyR2 activation.

Furthermore, SR Ca(2+) also showed a non-linear dependency with \u04a1Decay, however, the relationships \u028bwave vs. SR Ca(2+) and \u028bwave vs. dF/dt were linear, suggesting that high steady state SR Ca(2+) determines \u028bwave, while rapid SERCA Ca(2+) uptake does not.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of changes of SR Ca(2+) content and L-type Ca(2+) current in this alternans. As the amplitude of the depolarizing pulse was increased from 10 to 30 mV the magnitude of alternans decreased. Confocal linescan studies showed that this was accompanied by an increase in the number of sites from which Ca(2+) waves propagated. A sudden decrease in the depolarisation amplitude resulted in three classes of behaviour: (1) a gradual decrease in Ca(2+) transient amplitude before alternans developed accompanied by a loss of SR Ca(2+), (2) a gradual increase in Ca(2+) transient amplitude before alternans accompanied by a gain of SR Ca(2+), and (3) immediate development of alternans with no change of SR content. We conclude that alternans develops if the combination of decreased opening of L-type channels and change of SR Ca(2+) content results in spatially fragmented release from the SR as long as there is sufficient Ca(2+) in the SR to sustain wave propagation. Potentiation of the opening of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) by low concentrations of caffeine (100 microm) abolished alternans for a few pulses but the alternans then redeveloped once SR Ca(2+) content fell to the new threshold for wave propagation. Finally we show evidence that inhibiting L-type Ca(2+) current with 200 mum Cd(2+) produces alternans by means of a similar fragmentation of the Ca(2+) release profile and propagation of mini-waves of Ca(2+) release."

Ca(2+)influx through plasma membrane L-type Ca(2+)channels is thought to be an important trigger for opening ryanodine receptors (\"Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+)-release\"). Optimal transmission of the transmembrane Ca(2+)influx signal to SR release is predicted to involve spatial juxtaposition of L-type Ca(2+)channels to the ryanodine receptors of the junctional SR. Although such spatial coupling has often been implicitly assumed, and data from immunofluorescence microscopy are consistent with its existence, the definitive demonstration of such a structural organization in mammalian tissue is lacking at the electron-microscopic level. To determine the spatial distribution of plasma membrane L-type Ca(2+)channels and their location in relation to underlying junctional SR, we applied two high-resolution immunogold-labeling techniques, label-fracture and cryothin-sectioning, combined with quantitative analysis, to guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. Label-fracture enabled visualization of colloidal gold-labeled L-type Ca(2+)channels in planar freeze-fracture electron-microscopic views of the plasma membrane. Mathematical analysis of the gold label distribution (by nearest-neighbor distance distribution and the radial distribution function) demonstrated genuine clustering of the labeled channels. Gold-labeled cryosections showed that labeled L-type Ca(2+)channels quantitatively predominated in domains of the plasma membrane overlying junctional SR. These findings provide an ultrastructural basis for functional coupling between L-type Ca(2+)channels and junctional SR and for excitation-contraction coupling in guinea-pig cardiac muscle."

New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned to circumflex artery ligation or sham operation, and to DITPA administration (3.75 mg/kg/day) or no treatment in a two-by-two factorial design. After 3 weeks, echo-Doppler and LV hemodynamic measurements were performed. From ventricular tissue, single myocyte shortening and relaxation were determined, and Ca(2+)transport was measured in homogenates and SR-enriched microsomes. Levels of mRNA and protein content were determined for the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB), cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR-2) and calsequestrin. The administration of DITPA improved LV contraction and relaxation and improved myocyte shortening in infarcted animals. The improvements in LV and myocyte function were associated with increases in V(max)for SR Ca(2+)transport in both homogenates and microsomes. Also, DITPA prevented the decrease in LV protein density for SERCA2a, PLB and RyR-2 post-infarction, without measurable changes in mRNA levels. The thyroid hormone analogue, DITPA, improves LV, myocyte and SR function in infarcted hearts and prevents the downregulation of SR proteins associated with post-infarction heart failure. The specific effects of DITPA on post-infarction SR Ca(2+)transport and the expression of SR proteins make this compound a potentially useful therapeutic agent for LV systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction."

The results indicate that the ionic radii of the cations occupying Ca(2+)-binding sites in ACF I crucially affect the binding affinity of ACF I for alkaline earth metal ions as well as the structural stability of ACF I against GdnHCl denaturation. Sr(2+) and Ba(2+), with ionic radii larger than the ionic radius of Ca(2+), can bind to Ca(2+)-free ACF I (apo-ACF I), while Mg(2+), with an ionic radius smaller than that of Ca(2+), shows significantly low affinity for the binding to apo-ACF I. All bindings of Ca(2+), Sr(2+), and Ba(2+) ions in two sites of ACF I are mainly enthalpy-driven and the entropy is unfavorable for them. Sr(2+)-stabilized ACF I exhibits slightly lower resistance to GdnHCl denaturation than Ca(2+)-ACF I, while Ba(2+)-stabilized ACF I exhibits much lower resistance to GdnHCl denaturation than Ca(2+)-ACF I. Mg(2+) and Sr(2+), with ionic radii close to that of Ca(2+), can bind to FXa and therefore also induce the binding of ACF I to FXa, whereas Ba(2+), with a much larger ionic radius than Ca(2+), cannot support the binding of ACF I with FXa. Our observations suggest that bindings of Ca(2+), Sr(2+), and Ba(2+) ions in two sites of ACF I increase the structural stability of ACF I, but these bindings are not essential for the binding of ACF I with FXa, and that the binding of Mg(2+), Ca(2+), and Sr(2+) ions to FXa may be essential for the recognition between FXa and ACF I."

BH4 deficiency has been diagnosed in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) by neonatal mass-screening based on BH4 oral-loading tests, analysis of urinary or serum pteridines, and measurement of DHPR activity in blood using a Guthrie card. BH4 deficiency without treatment causes combined symptoms of HPA and neurotransmitter (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin) deficiency, such as red hair, psychomotor retardation, and progressive neurological deterioration. However, autosomal dominant GTPCH deficiency and autosomal recessive SR deficiency leads to BH4 and neurotransmitter deficiency without HPA and may not be detected by neonatal screening for phenylketonuria. The former is Segawa's disease, which is characterized by dopa-responsive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation and is caused by a defect of GTPCH, and the latter is SR deficiency, which is characterized by progressive psychomotor retardation, dystonia, and severe dopamine and serotonin deficiencies. Biochemical diagnosis is performed by the measurement of neopterin and biopterin levels, since both are low in Segawa disease, and the biopterin level is high in SR deficiency in cerebrospinal fluid.

The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes.

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine their affinity and selectivity are correspondingly important. Herein, we have determined the relative strengths of intramolecular interactions between a series of monosaccharides and an aromatic ring close to the glycosylation site in an N-glycoprotein host. We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars. Galactose seems to make the weakest and allose the strongest sugar-aromatic interactions, with glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in between. The NMR solution structures of several of the monosaccharide-containing N-glycoproteins were solved to further understand the origins of the similarities and differences between the monosaccharide-aromatic interaction energies. Peracetylation of the monosaccharides substantially increases the strength of the sugar-aromatic interaction in the context of our N-glycoprotein host. Finally, we discuss our results in light of recent literature regarding the contribution of electrostatics to CH-\u03c0 interactions and speculate on what our observations imply about the absolute conservation of GlcNAc as the monosaccharide through which N-linked glycans are attached to glycoproteins in eukaryotes.

In the present study, evidence is presented that serovar Typhimurium SR-11 mutants that cannot convert fumarate to malate or that cannot convert malate to both oxaloacetate and pyruvate are also avirulent and protective in BALB/c mice. These results suggest that in BALB/c mice, the malate that is removed from the TCA cycle in serovar Typhimurium SR-11 for conversion to pyruvate must be replenished by succinate or one of its precursors, e.g., arginine or ornithine, which might be available in mouse phagocytes."

Acute intraperitoneal administration of varying doses of SR 141716A produced both scratchings (ED50 = 3.9 mg/kg) and head-twitches (ED50 = 4.6 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. A dose of 10 mg/kg SR 141716A was used to induce the cited behaviors for drug interaction studies. The selective 5-HT2A/C receptor antagonist, SR 46349B [trans-4-[(3Z)3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl) oxyimino-3-(2-fluorophenyl) propen-1-yl] phenol] potently and completely blocked the head-twitches produced by SR 141716A (ID50 = 0.08 mg/kg). The induced scratching behavior was partially (68%) and less potently (ID50 = 0.6 mg/kg) blocked by SR 46349B pretreatment. The AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, CNQX [6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione], partially attenuated (68-78%) the induced scratching and head-twitching behaviors. On the contrary, the selective NMDA antagonist, AP-3 [(+/-)-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid], had no significant effect on these behaviors. The selective tachykinin NK1 antagonist, CP 94, 994 [(+/-)-(2S, 3S)-3-(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine], also partially attenuated both the scratching (64%) and the head-twitching (76%) symptoms produced by SR 141716A. Since SR 141716A lacks affinity for the discussed receptors, it appears that the induction of the cited behaviors probably involve indirect activation of their respective neurotransmitter systems."

Applying these calibrations to fossil corals assumes that the temperature sensitivity of skeletal Sr/Ca is conserved, despite substantial changes in seawater carbonate chemistry between the modern and glacial ocean. We present Sr/Ca analyses of 3 genotypes of massive Porites spp. corals (the genus most commonly used for palaeoclimate reconstruction), cultured under seawater pCO2 reflecting modern, future (year 2100) and last glacial maximum (LGM) conditions. Skeletal Sr/Ca is indistinguishable between duplicate colonies of the same genotype cultured under the same conditions, but varies significantly in response to seawater pCO2 in two genotypes of Porites lutea, whilst Porites murrayensis is unaffected. Within P. lutea, the response is not systematic: skeletal Sr/Ca increases significantly (by 2-4%) at high seawater pCO2 relative to modern in both genotypes, and also increases significantly (by 4%) at low seawater pCO2 in one genotype. This magnitude of variation equates to errors in reconstructed SST of up to -5\u2009\u00b0C. "

Humans contain an alternative route of HDL-CE clearance, namely through the transfer by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) to apolipoprotein B lipoproteins for subsequent uptake via the LDL receptor. In this study, we determined whether CETP can compensate for loss of adrenal SR-BI. Transgenic expression of human CETP (CETP Tg) in SR-BI knockout (KO) mice increased adrenal HDL-CE clearance from 33-58% of the control value. SR-BI KO/CETP Tg and SR-BI KO mice displayed adrenal hypertrophy due to equally high plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. Adrenal cholesterol levels and plasma corticosterone levels were 38-52% decreased in SR-BI KO mice with and without CETP expression. SR-BI KO/CETP Tg mice also failed to increase their corticosterone level after lipopolysaccharide challenge, leading to an identical >4-fold increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha response compared with controls. These data indicate that uptake of CE via other routes than SR-BI is not sufficient to generate the cholesterol pool needed for optimal adrenal steroidogenesis. In conclusion, we have shown that CETP-mediated transfer of HDL-CE is not able to reverse adrenal insufficiency in SR-BI knockout mice. Thus, SR-BI-mediated uptake of serum cholesterol is essential for optimal adrenal function."

Secretory group IIa phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)) is a cytokine-induced acute-phase enzyme associated with HDL. Transgenic mice overexpressing sPLA(2) have reduced HDL levels. Studies were performed to define the mechanism for the HDL reduction in these mice. HDL isolated from sPLA(2) transgenic mice have a significantly lower phospholipid content and greater triglyceride content. In autologous clearance studies, (125)I-labeled HDL from sPLA(2) transgenic mice was catabolized significantly faster than HDL from control mice (4.24 +/- 1.16 vs. 2.84 +/- 0.1 pools per day, P < 0.008). In both sPLA(2) transgenic and control mice, the cholesteryl ester component of HDL was more rapidly catabolized than the protein component, indicating a selective uptake mechanism. In vitro studies using CHO cells transfected with scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) showed that sPLA(2)-modified HDL was nearly twice as efficient as a substrate for cholesteryl ester transfer. These data were confirmed in in vivo selective uptake experiments using adenoviral vector overexpression of SR-BI. In these studies, increased hepatic selective uptake was associated with increased (125)I-labeled apolipoprotein uptake in the kidney. We conclude that during inflammation sPLA(2) hydrolysis of HDL phospholipids alters the lipid composition of the particle, allowing for more efficient SR-BI-mediated selective cholesteryl ester uptake. This enhanced SR-BI activity generates HDL remnants that are preferentially catabolized in the kidney."

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure."

Levels of mRNA and protein content were determined for the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB), cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR-2) and calsequestrin. The administration of DITPA improved LV contraction and relaxation and improved myocyte shortening in infarcted animals. The improvements in LV and myocyte function were associated with increases in V(max)for SR Ca(2+)transport in both homogenates and microsomes. Also, DITPA prevented the decrease in LV protein density for SERCA2a, PLB and RyR-2 post-infarction, without measurable changes in mRNA levels. The thyroid hormone analogue, DITPA, improves LV, myocyte and SR function in infarcted hearts and prevents the downregulation of SR proteins associated with post-infarction heart failure. The specific effects of DITPA on post-infarction SR Ca(2+)transport and the expression of SR proteins make this compound a potentially useful therapeutic agent for LV systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction."

The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA."

We propose that at low excitation rates back electron flow and charge recombination between the QB*- or QA*- semiquinone acceptors and the oxidized S(2,3) states of the PSII donor side may cause oxidative damage via generation of active oxygen species. Therefore, damage per photochemical event should increase with decreasing rates of PSII excitation. To test this hypothesis, the effect of the dark interval between single turnover flashes on the inactivation of water oxidation, charge separation and recombination, and the degradation of D1 protein were determined in spinach thylakoids. PSII inactivation per flash increases as the dark interval between the flashes increases, and a plateau is reached at dark intervals, allowing complete charge recombination of the QB*-/S2,3 or QA*-/S2 states (about 200 and 40 s, respectively). At these excitation rates: (i) 0.7% and 0.4% of PSII is inactivated and 0.4% and 0.2% of the D1 protein is degraded per flash, respectively, and (ii) the damage per flash is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that induced by equal amount of energy delivered by excess continuous light.

In buffered solutions equilibrated with the atmosphere (nondepleted of bicarbonate), the bicarbonate effect is observed only at pH lower than the pK of H2CO3 dissociation (6.4), which indicates that HCO3- is the essential species for the restoration effect. The addition of just 2 Mn2+ atoms per one PSII reaction center is enough for the maximal reactivation when bicarbonate is present in the medium. Analysis of bicarbonate concentration dependence of the restoration effect reveals two binding sites for bicarbonate with apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 2.5 microM and 20-34 microM when 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone is used as electron acceptor, while in the presence of silicomolybdate only the latter one remains. Similar bicarbonate concentration dependence of O2 evolution was obtained in untreated Mn-containing PSII membrane fragments. It is suggested that the Kd of 20-34 microM is associated with the donor side of PSII while the location of the lower Kd binding site is not quite clear.

These mutants did not form colonies at 42 degrees C on minimal medium plates and had elevated ribosome concentrations and higher growth rates at 30 degrees C. Genetic mapping by phage P1 transduction and complementation analyses showed that the mutations were located in spoT and that they were recessive. Specific inhibition of SpoT-dependent ppGpp degradation activity with picolinic acid showed that two of the mutants tested were deficient in ppGpp synthesis activity.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure."

We conclude with an outlook for the opportunity of future MS contributions to PSII research. "

Removal of the CP47 subunit, which increases accessibility of FtsH to the D2 subunit, induced dark degradation of D2 at a faster rate than that of D1.

We propose that at low excitation rates back electron flow and charge recombination between the QB*- or QA*- semiquinone acceptors and the oxidized S(2,3) states of the PSII donor side may cause oxidative damage via generation of active oxygen species. Therefore, damage per photochemical event should increase with decreasing rates of PSII excitation. To test this hypothesis, the effect of the dark interval between single turnover flashes on the inactivation of water oxidation, charge separation and recombination, and the degradation of D1 protein were determined in spinach thylakoids. PSII inactivation per flash increases as the dark interval between the flashes increases, and a plateau is reached at dark intervals, allowing complete charge recombination of the QB*-/S2,3 or QA*-/S2 states (about 200 and 40 s, respectively). At these excitation rates: (i) 0.7% and 0.4% of PSII is inactivated and 0.4% and 0.2% of the D1 protein is degraded per flash, respectively, and (ii) the damage per flash is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that induced by equal amount of energy delivered by excess continuous light. No PSII damage occurs if flashes are given in anaerobic conditions. These results demonstrate that charge recombination in active PSII is promoted by low rates of excitation and may account for a the high quantum efficiency of the rapid turnover of the D1 protein induced by limiting light."

It is based on the accurate determination of the so-called Fm('), i.e. the fluorescence signal emitted when a \"saturating\" light pulse closes all PSII centers. In this methodological investigation, we examined whether the saturating pulse intensities required to obtain maximal fluorescence yields differ between leaves of various species receiving varying actinic light irradiances. It was shown that, in leaves adapted to comparatively high (yet realistic) levels of natural irradiances, the saturating pulses usually applied are not able to close all PSII reaction centers. As a result, there is a high risk of considerable Fm(') underestimation. Accordingly, the derived values of effective PSII yields and linear electron transport rates (ETR) are also underestimated, even at the highest saturation pulse levels afforded by commercial instruments. Since the extent of underestimation increases with actinic irradiance, the ETR versus light curves are considerably distorted. The possible reasons for the apparent inability of \"saturating\" pulses to close all PSII centers at high actinic light and the practical implications, especially in field work, are discussed."

Measurements of Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I activity by Clark-type oxygen electrode demonstrated that electron flow is impaired primarily in PSII. The site and mechanism of UV-A induced damage within PSII was assessed by flash-induced oxygen and thermoluminescence (TL) measurements. The flash pattern of oxygen evolution showed an increased amount of the S0 state in the dark, which indicate a direct effect of UV-A in the water-oxidizing complex. TL measurements revealed the UV-A induced loss of PSII centers in which charge recombination between the S2 state of the water oxidizing complex and the semireduced Q(A)- and Q(B)- quinone electron acceptors occur. Flash-induced oscillation of the B TL band, originating from the S2Q(B)- recombination, showed a decreased amplitude after the second flash relative to that after the first one, which is consistent with a decrease in the amount of Q(B)- relative to Q(B) in dark adapted samples. The efficiency of UV-A light in inhibiting PSII electron transport exceeds that of visible light 45-fold on the basis of equal energy and 60-fold on the basis of equal photon number, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that UV-A radiation is highly damaging for PSII, whose electron transport is affected both at the water oxidizing complex, and the binding site of the Q(B) quinone electron acceptor in a similar way to that caused by UV-B radiation."

PCC 6803 wild type, CK pigment mutant lacking phycocyanin, and PAL mutant totally devoid of phycobiliproteins. The permanent presence of PBS-specific peaks in the in situ action spectra of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), as well as in the 77 K fluorescence excitation spectra for chlorophyll emission at 690 nm (PSII) and 725 nm (PSI) showed that PBS are constitutive antenna complexes of both photosystems. The mutant strains compensated the lack of phycobiliproteins by higher PSII content and by intensification of photosynthetic linear electron transfer. The detectable changes of energy migration from PBS to the PSI and PSII in the Synechocystis wild type and the CK mutant in State 1 and State 2 according to the fluorescence excitation spectra measurements were not registered. The constant level of fluorescence emission of PSI during State 1/State 2 transitions and simultaneous increase of chlorophyll fluorescence emission of PSII in State 1 in Synechocystis PAL mutant allowed to propose that spillover is an unlikely mechanism of state transitions. Blue-green light absorbed by OCP diminished the rout of energy from PBS to PSI while energy migration from PBS to PSII was less influenced. Therefore, the main role of OCP-induced quenching of PBS is the limitation of PSI activity and cyclic electron transport under relatively high light conditions."

In buffered solutions equilibrated with the atmosphere (nondepleted of bicarbonate), the bicarbonate effect is observed only at pH lower than the pK of H2CO3 dissociation (6.4), which indicates that HCO3- is the essential species for the restoration effect. The addition of just 2 Mn2+ atoms per one PSII reaction center is enough for the maximal reactivation when bicarbonate is present in the medium. Analysis of bicarbonate concentration dependence of the restoration effect reveals two binding sites for bicarbonate with apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 2.5 microM and 20-34 microM when 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone is used as electron acceptor, while in the presence of silicomolybdate only the latter one remains. Similar bicarbonate concentration dependence of O2 evolution was obtained in untreated Mn-containing PSII membrane fragments. It is suggested that the Kd of 20-34 microM is associated with the donor side of PSII while the location of the lower Kd binding site is not quite clear. The conclusion is made that bicarbonate is an essential constituent of the water-oxidizing complex of PSII, important for its assembly and maintenance in the functionally active state."

The data are modeled in terms of electron transfer (ET) and associated protein conformational relaxation processes, resolving four different radical pair (RP) states. The target analyses reveal the importance of protein relaxation steps in the ET chain for the functioning of PSII. We also tested previously published data on cyanobacterial PSII with open RCs using models that involved protein relaxation steps as suggested by our data on closed RCs. The rationale for this reanalysis is that at least one short-lived component could not be described in the previous simpler models. This new analysis supports the involvement of a protein relaxation step for open RCs as well. In this model the rate of ET from reduced pheophytin to the primary quinone Q(A) is determined to be 4.1 ns(-1). The rate of initial charge separation is slowed down substantially from approximately 170 ns(-1) in PSII with open RCs to 56 ns(-1) upon reduction of Q(A). However, the free-energy drop of the first RP is not changed substantially between the two RC redox states. The currently assumed mechanistic model, assuming the same early RP intermediates in both states of RC, is inconsistent with the presented energetics of the RPs. Additionally, a comparison between PSII with closed RCs in isolated cores and in intact cells reveals slightly different relaxation kinetics, with a approximately 3.7 ns component present only in isolated cores."

The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2.

We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars.

We propose that at low excitation rates back electron flow and charge recombination between the QB*- or QA*- semiquinone acceptors and the oxidized S(2,3) states of the PSII donor side may cause oxidative damage via generation of active oxygen species. Therefore, damage per photochemical event should increase with decreasing rates of PSII excitation. To test this hypothesis, the effect of the dark interval between single turnover flashes on the inactivation of water oxidation, charge separation and recombination, and the degradation of D1 protein were determined in spinach thylakoids. PSII inactivation per flash increases as the dark interval between the flashes increases, and a plateau is reached at dark intervals, allowing complete charge recombination of the QB*-/S2,3 or QA*-/S2 states (about 200 and 40 s, respectively). At these excitation rates: (i) 0.7% and 0.4% of PSII is inactivated and 0.4% and 0.2% of the D1 protein is degraded per flash, respectively, and (ii) the damage per flash is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that induced by equal amount of energy delivered by excess continuous light. No PSII damage occurs if flashes are given in anaerobic conditions. These results demonstrate that charge recombination in active PSII is promoted by low rates of excitation and may account for a the high quantum efficiency of the rapid turnover of the D1 protein induced by limiting light."

In this methodological investigation, we examined whether the saturating pulse intensities required to obtain maximal fluorescence yields differ between leaves of various species receiving varying actinic light irradiances. It was shown that, in leaves adapted to comparatively high (yet realistic) levels of natural irradiances, the saturating pulses usually applied are not able to close all PSII reaction centers. As a result, there is a high risk of considerable Fm(') underestimation. Accordingly, the derived values of effective PSII yields and linear electron transport rates (ETR) are also underestimated, even at the highest saturation pulse levels afforded by commercial instruments. Since the extent of underestimation increases with actinic irradiance, the ETR versus light curves are considerably distorted. The possible reasons for the apparent inability of \"saturating\" pulses to close all PSII centers at high actinic light and the practical implications, especially in field work, are discussed."

Measurements of Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I activity by Clark-type oxygen electrode demonstrated that electron flow is impaired primarily in PSII. The site and mechanism of UV-A induced damage within PSII was assessed by flash-induced oxygen and thermoluminescence (TL) measurements. The flash pattern of oxygen evolution showed an increased amount of the S0 state in the dark, which indicate a direct effect of UV-A in the water-oxidizing complex. TL measurements revealed the UV-A induced loss of PSII centers in which charge recombination between the S2 state of the water oxidizing complex and the semireduced Q(A)- and Q(B)- quinone electron acceptors occur. Flash-induced oscillation of the B TL band, originating from the S2Q(B)- recombination, showed a decreased amplitude after the second flash relative to that after the first one, which is consistent with a decrease in the amount of Q(B)- relative to Q(B) in dark adapted samples. The efficiency of UV-A light in inhibiting PSII electron transport exceeds that of visible light 45-fold on the basis of equal energy and 60-fold on the basis of equal photon number, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that UV-A radiation is highly damaging for PSII, whose electron transport is affected both at the water oxidizing complex, and the binding site of the Q(B) quinone electron acceptor in a similar way to that caused by UV-B radiation."

The permanent presence of PBS-specific peaks in the in situ action spectra of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), as well as in the 77 K fluorescence excitation spectra for chlorophyll emission at 690 nm (PSII) and 725 nm (PSI) showed that PBS are constitutive antenna complexes of both photosystems. The mutant strains compensated the lack of phycobiliproteins by higher PSII content and by intensification of photosynthetic linear electron transfer. The detectable changes of energy migration from PBS to the PSI and PSII in the Synechocystis wild type and the CK mutant in State 1 and State 2 according to the fluorescence excitation spectra measurements were not registered. The constant level of fluorescence emission of PSI during State 1/State 2 transitions and simultaneous increase of chlorophyll fluorescence emission of PSII in State 1 in Synechocystis PAL mutant allowed to propose that spillover is an unlikely mechanism of state transitions. Blue-green light absorbed by OCP diminished the rout of energy from PBS to PSI while energy migration from PBS to PSII was less influenced. Therefore, the main role of OCP-induced quenching of PBS is the limitation of PSI activity and cyclic electron transport under relatively high light conditions."

The target analyses reveal the importance of protein relaxation steps in the ET chain for the functioning of PSII. We also tested previously published data on cyanobacterial PSII with open RCs using models that involved protein relaxation steps as suggested by our data on closed RCs. The rationale for this reanalysis is that at least one short-lived component could not be described in the previous simpler models. This new analysis supports the involvement of a protein relaxation step for open RCs as well. In this model the rate of ET from reduced pheophytin to the primary quinone Q(A) is determined to be 4.1 ns(-1). The rate of initial charge separation is slowed down substantially from approximately 170 ns(-1) in PSII with open RCs to 56 ns(-1) upon reduction of Q(A). However, the free-energy drop of the first RP is not changed substantially between the two RC redox states. The currently assumed mechanistic model, assuming the same early RP intermediates in both states of RC, is inconsistent with the presented energetics of the RPs. Additionally, a comparison between PSII with closed RCs in isolated cores and in intact cells reveals slightly different relaxation kinetics, with a approximately 3.7 ns component present only in isolated cores."

In buffered solutions equilibrated with the atmosphere (nondepleted of bicarbonate), the bicarbonate effect is observed only at pH lower than the pK of H2CO3 dissociation (6.4), which indicates that HCO3- is the essential species for the restoration effect. The addition of just 2 Mn2+ atoms per one PSII reaction center is enough for the maximal reactivation when bicarbonate is present in the medium.

Balance is achieved through a process of 'state transitions' that increases energy transfer towards PSI when PSII is overexcited (state II), and towards PSII when PSI is overexcited (state I). This is achieved through redox control of the phosphorylation state of light-harvesting antenna complex II (LHCII). PSI is served by both LHCII and four light-harvesting antenna complex I (LHCI) subunits, Lhca1, 2, 3 and 4. Here we demonstrate that despite unchanged levels of LHCII phosphorylation, absence of specific Lhca subunits reduces state transitions in Arabidopsis. The severest phenotype-observed in a mutant lacking Lhca4 (\u0394Lhca4)-displayed a 69% reduction compared with the wild type. Yet, surprisingly, the amounts of the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex isolated by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) from digitonin-solubilized thylakoids were similar in the wild type and \u0394Lhca mutants. Fluorescence excitation spectroscopy revealed that in the wild type this PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex is supplemented by energy transfer from additional LHCII trimers in state II, whose binding is sensitive to digitonin, and which are absent in \u0394Lhca4. The grana margins of the thylakoid membrane were found to be the primary site of interaction between this 'extra' LHCII and the PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplex in state II. The results suggest that the LHCI complexes mediate energetic interactions between LHCII and PSI in the intact membrane. "

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure."

It was shown that, in leaves adapted to comparatively high (yet realistic) levels of natural irradiances, the saturating pulses usually applied are not able to close all PSII reaction centers. As a result, there is a high risk of considerable Fm(') underestimation. Accordingly, the derived values of effective PSII yields and linear electron transport rates (ETR) are also underestimated, even at the highest saturation pulse levels afforded by commercial instruments. Since the extent of underestimation increases with actinic irradiance, the ETR versus light curves are considerably distorted. The possible reasons for the apparent inability of \"saturating\" pulses to close all PSII centers at high actinic light and the practical implications, especially in field work, are discussed."

Measurements of Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I activity by Clark-type oxygen electrode demonstrated that electron flow is impaired primarily in PSII. The site and mechanism of UV-A induced damage within PSII was assessed by flash-induced oxygen and thermoluminescence (TL) measurements. The flash pattern of oxygen evolution showed an increased amount of the S0 state in the dark, which indicate a direct effect of UV-A in the water-oxidizing complex. TL measurements revealed the UV-A induced loss of PSII centers in which charge recombination between the S2 state of the water oxidizing complex and the semireduced Q(A)- and Q(B)- quinone electron acceptors occur. Flash-induced oscillation of the B TL band, originating from the S2Q(B)- recombination, showed a decreased amplitude after the second flash relative to that after the first one, which is consistent with a decrease in the amount of Q(B)- relative to Q(B) in dark adapted samples. The efficiency of UV-A light in inhibiting PSII electron transport exceeds that of visible light 45-fold on the basis of equal energy and 60-fold on the basis of equal photon number, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that UV-A radiation is highly damaging for PSII, whose electron transport is affected both at the water oxidizing complex, and the binding site of the Q(B) quinone electron acceptor in a similar way to that caused by UV-B radiation."

PCC 6803 wild type, CK pigment mutant lacking phycocyanin, and PAL mutant totally devoid of phycobiliproteins. The permanent presence of PBS-specific peaks in the in situ action spectra of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), as well as in the 77 K fluorescence excitation spectra for chlorophyll emission at 690 nm (PSII) and 725 nm (PSI) showed that PBS are constitutive antenna complexes of both photosystems. The mutant strains compensated the lack of phycobiliproteins by higher PSII content and by intensification of photosynthetic linear electron transfer. The detectable changes of energy migration from PBS to the PSI and PSII in the Synechocystis wild type and the CK mutant in State 1 and State 2 according to the fluorescence excitation spectra measurements were not registered. The constant level of fluorescence emission of PSI during State 1/State 2 transitions and simultaneous increase of chlorophyll fluorescence emission of PSII in State 1 in Synechocystis PAL mutant allowed to propose that spillover is an unlikely mechanism of state transitions. Blue-green light absorbed by OCP diminished the rout of energy from PBS to PSI while energy migration from PBS to PSII was less influenced. Therefore, the main role of OCP-induced quenching of PBS is the limitation of PSI activity and cyclic electron transport under relatively high light conditions."

In buffered solutions equilibrated with the atmosphere (nondepleted of bicarbonate), the bicarbonate effect is observed only at pH lower than the pK of H2CO3 dissociation (6.4), which indicates that HCO3- is the essential species for the restoration effect. The addition of just 2 Mn2+ atoms per one PSII reaction center is enough for the maximal reactivation when bicarbonate is present in the medium. Analysis of bicarbonate concentration dependence of the restoration effect reveals two binding sites for bicarbonate with apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 2.5 microM and 20-34 microM when 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone is used as electron acceptor, while in the presence of silicomolybdate only the latter one remains. Similar bicarbonate concentration dependence of O2 evolution was obtained in untreated Mn-containing PSII membrane fragments. It is suggested that the Kd of 20-34 microM is associated with the donor side of PSII while the location of the lower Kd binding site is not quite clear. The conclusion is made that bicarbonate is an essential constituent of the water-oxidizing complex of PSII, important for its assembly and maintenance in the functionally active state."

The data are modeled in terms of electron transfer (ET) and associated protein conformational relaxation processes, resolving four different radical pair (RP) states. The target analyses reveal the importance of protein relaxation steps in the ET chain for the functioning of PSII. We also tested previously published data on cyanobacterial PSII with open RCs using models that involved protein relaxation steps as suggested by our data on closed RCs. The rationale for this reanalysis is that at least one short-lived component could not be described in the previous simpler models. This new analysis supports the involvement of a protein relaxation step for open RCs as well. In this model the rate of ET from reduced pheophytin to the primary quinone Q(A) is determined to be 4.1 ns(-1). The rate of initial charge separation is slowed down substantially from approximately 170 ns(-1) in PSII with open RCs to 56 ns(-1) upon reduction of Q(A). However, the free-energy drop of the first RP is not changed substantially between the two RC redox states. The currently assumed mechanistic model, assuming the same early RP intermediates in both states of RC, is inconsistent with the presented energetics of the RPs. Additionally, a comparison between PSII with closed RCs in isolated cores and in intact cells reveals slightly different relaxation kinetics, with a approximately 3.7 ns component present only in isolated cores."

In vitro reconstitution of the purified apoprotein was achieved using an incubation mixture containing purified precursor Z, purified MPT synthase, and sodium molybdate.

The shift of the characteristic IR band of the PT ring and the emergence of two charge transfer bands at 254nm and 246nm in UV difference spectra show the presence of pi-pi complexation between folic acid and anthracene. These experiments confirm that anthracene could combine with the pterin ring of folic acid through pi-pi donor-acceptor interaction (EDA) and induce the protonation process in FA upon strengthening electron accepting ability of PT ring."

Current strength susceptibilities have been obtained by numerically integrating separately the diatropic and paratropic contributions to the current flow passing planes through chosen bonds of the molecules. The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2. The calculated current patterns elucidate why the compounds with formally [4n + 2] \u03c0-electrons have unusual aromatic properties violating the H\u00fcckel \u03c0-electron count rule. The current density calculations also provide valuable information for interpreting the measured (1)H NMR spectra. "

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine their affinity and selectivity are correspondingly important. Herein, we have determined the relative strengths of intramolecular interactions between a series of monosaccharides and an aromatic ring close to the glycosylation site in an N-glycoprotein host. We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars. Galactose seems to make the weakest and allose the strongest sugar-aromatic interactions, with glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in between. The NMR solution structures of several of the monosaccharide-containing N-glycoproteins were solved to further understand the origins of the similarities and differences between the monosaccharide-aromatic interaction energies. Peracetylation of the monosaccharides substantially increases the strength of the sugar-aromatic interaction in the context of our N-glycoprotein host. Finally, we discuss our results in light of recent literature regarding the contribution of electrostatics to CH-\u03c0 interactions and speculate on what our observations imply about the absolute conservation of GlcNAc as the monosaccharide through which N-linked glycans are attached to glycoproteins in eukaryotes.

These occur both within repeating elements of secondary structure and in tertiary and quaternary interactions. It has been suggested that they are important in protein folding and stability, and non-bonded potential energy calculations indicate that a typical aromatic-aromatic interaction has an energy of between -1 and -2 kcal/mol and contributes between -0.6 and -1.3 kcal/mol to protein stability. There is such an aromatic pair on the solvent-exposed face of the first alpha-helix of barnase, the small ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The edge of the aromatic ring of Tyr17 interacts with the face of that of Tyr13. The two residues have been mutated both singly and pairwise to alanine, and their free energies of unfolding determined by denaturation with urea. Application of the double-mutant cycle analysis gives an interaction energy of -1.3 kcal/mol for the aromatic pair in the folded protein relative to solvation by water in the unfolded protein. This value is similar to that calculated from the change in surface-accessible area between the rings on the formation of the pair. Analysis of a further double-mutant cycle in which the Tyr residues are mutated to Phe indicates that the aromatic-aromatic interactions of Tyr/Tyr and Phe/Phe make identical contributions to protein stability. However, Tyr is preferred to Phe by 0.3(+/- 0.04) kcal/mol at the solvent-exposed face of the alpha-helix."

The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA."

Its balanced sugar (cellobiose, lactose, mannitol, and trehalose) and protein (beef extract and polypeptone peptone) formulation provided Salmonella with a selective growth advantage over non-Salmonella enteric organisms. The formulations promoted the production and detection of H2S production levels that otherwise might be missed with traditional agar formulations. In combination, these advantages contributed to increased sensitivity without the loss of specificity. In comparative studies using 86 samples of meat products (beef, pork, and chicken), the new media, Miller-Mallinson (MM) agar and xylose lysine tergitol (Niaproof) 4 agar, possessed significantly higher sensitivity (P < 0.001) and an improved specificity over bismuth sulfite, hektoen enteric, and xylose lysine desoxycholate agars. However, these samples did not contain nontyphoid salmonellae with weak to ultraweak H2S production characteristics. Modified formulations of MM agar were generally similar to bismuth sulfite and hektoen enteric agars in the identification of four of seven globally diverse strains of Salmonella serotype Typhi. Two of these seven strains were found to produce more readily identifiable black (H2S-positive) colonies on MM agar, whereas one of the seven was not readily detected by any of the media. The improved detection of nontyphoid and typhoid salmonellae attests to the sensitivity of MM agar and to its potentially broad utility in both clinical and food quality laboratories."

In this study, we have developed a series of IP(3) biosensors that exhibit strong pH stability and varying affinities for IP(3), as well as a method for the quantitative measurement of cytosolic concentrations of IP(3) ([IP(3)](i)) in single living cells. We applied this method to elucidate IP(3) dynamics during agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations, and we demonstrated cell type-dependent differences in IP(3) dynamics, a nonfluctuating rise in [IP(3)](i) and repetitive IP(3) spikes during Ca(2+) oscillations in COS-7 cells and HSY-EA1 cells, respectively. The size of the IP(3) spikes in HSY-EA1 cells varied from 10 to 100 nm, and the [IP(3)](i) spike peak was preceded by a Ca(2+) spike peak. These results suggest that repetitive IP(3) spikes in HSY-EA1 cells are passive reflections of Ca(2+) oscillations, and are unlikely to be essential for driving Ca(2+) oscillations. In addition, the interspike periods of Ca(2+) oscillations that occurred during the slow rise in [IP(3)](i) were not shortened by the rise in [IP(3)](i), indicating that IP(3)-dependent and -independent mechanisms may regulate the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations. The novel method described herein as well as the quantitative information obtained by using this method should provide a valuable and sound basis for future studies on the spatial and temporal regulations of IP(3) and Ca(2+)."

This study undertakes to identify the InsP(3)receptor subtypes (isoforms) in heart and aorta and to characterize their functional properties. The InsP(3)receptor isoforms were identified from rat heart and aorta tissues using both reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to assess the presence of mRNA for the different isoforms and immunochemistry using InsP(3)receptor isoform-specific antibodies. Functional studies included ligand binding experiments using [(3)H]InsP(3)and InsP(3)-induced Ca(2+)release studies using Fluo-3 as the Ca(2+)sensing dye. All three isoforms of the InsP(3)receptor were identified using RT-PCR and immunochemical analyses. [(3)H]InsP(3)binding studies using microsomes derived from these tissues showed that heart had a 3-fold lower abundance of InsP(3)receptors than aorta, while both have considerably lower abundance than the well characterized cerebellar microsomes. The affinity of the InsP(3)binding to the receptor was also different in the three tissues. In cerebellum the K(d)was 60 nM, while aorta had a much higher K(d)of 220 nM. Heart microsomes, appeared to show two classes of binding affinity with K(d)s of 150 nM and 60 nM. Furthermore, the effects of free [Ca(2+)] on [(3)H]InsP(3)binding levels were also different for the three tissues. InsP(3)binding to both cerebellar and aorta microsomes decreased by 90% and 60%, respectively, above 30 nM free [Ca(2+)], while InsP(3)binding to heart was relatively insensitive to changes in [Ca(2+)]. At maximal InsP(3)concentrations, aorta microsomes were able to release about 5% of the accumulated Ca(2+), compared to 25% by cerebellar microsomes. Heart microsomes, however, showed only very little InsP(3)-induced Ca(2+)release ( <0.5%). The EC(50)concentration for InsP(3)-induced Ca(2+)release was 1.2 micro M for aorta while that for cerebellum was 0.3 micro M. Known agonists of the cerebellar InsP(3)receptor such as 3-deoxy InsP(3)and adenophostin A were also able to mobilize Ca(2+)from aorta microsomes.

In all cases, ATP evoked an inward current and a rise in [Ca(2+)](i). P2XR subtypes differed in the peak amplitude of [Ca(2+)](i) response independently of the level of receptor expression, with the following order: P2X(1)R < P2X(3)R < P2X(4)R < P2X(2b)R < P2X(2a)R < P2X(7)R.

The pattern of [Ca(2+)](i) response for each P2XR subtype was highly comparable with that of the depolarizing current, but the activation and desensitization rates were faster for the current than for [Ca(2+)](i). The P2X(1)R, P2X(3)R, and P2X(4)R-derived [Ca(2+)](i) signals were predominantly dependent on activation of voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) influx, both voltage-sensitive and -insensitive Ca(2+) entry pathways equally contributed to [Ca(2+)](i) responses in P2X(2a)R- and P2X(2b)R-expressing cells, and P2X(7)R operated as a nonselective pore capable of conducting larger amounts of Ca(2+) independently on the status of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels.

The [Ca(2+)](i) increases were abolished by Ca(2+)-free superfusate and attenuated by approximately 65% by nifedipine, showing that the responses were mediated by voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels.

To address these points, we evoked SR Ca(2+) release by rapid application of caffeine in indo 1-AM-loaded rabbit ventricular myocytes and measured caffeine-induced DADs (cDADs) with whole-cell current clamp. The SR Ca(2+) load of the myocyte was varied by different AP frequencies. The cDAD amplitude doubled for every 88+/-8 nmol/L of Delta[Ca(2+)](i) (simple exponential), and the Delta[Ca(2+)](i) threshold of 424+/-58 nmol/L was sufficient to trigger an AP. Blocking Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange current (I(Na/Ca)) by removal of [Na](o) and [Ca(2+)](o) (or with 5 mmol/L Ni(2+)) reduced cDADs by >90%, for the same Delta[Ca(2+)](i). In contrast, blockade of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (I(Cl(Ca))) with 50 micromol/L niflumate did not significantly alter cDADs. We conclude that DADs are almost entirely due to I(Na/Ca), not I(Cl(Ca)) or Ca(2+)-activated nonselective cation current. To trigger an AP requires 30 to 40 micromol/L cytosolic Ca(2+) or a [Ca(2+)](i) transient of 424 nmol/L. Current injection, simulating I(ti)s with different time courses, revealed that faster I:(ti)s require less charge for AP triggering. Given that spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release occurs in waves, which are slower than cDADs or fast I(ti)s, the true Delta[Ca(2+)](i) threshold for AP activation may be approximately 3-fold higher in normal myocytes.

Current strength susceptibilities have been obtained by numerically integrating separately the diatropic and paratropic contributions to the current flow passing planes through chosen bonds of the molecules. The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2. The calculated current patterns elucidate why the compounds with formally [4n + 2] \u03c0-electrons have unusual aromatic properties violating the H\u00fcckel \u03c0-electron count rule. The current density calculations also provide valuable information for interpreting the measured (1)H NMR spectra. "

Because of the concern of the resistance to most of the commonly used drugs displayed by the considered mycobacteria, most efforts have been done to introduce new anti-tubercular agents. Recent studies showed that 1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarbamoyl derivatives with lipophilic groups have significant anti-tubercular activity. In this study, we synthesized new derivatives of 1,4-dihydropyridines in which different alkyl and aryl esters and diethyl carbamoyl are substituted in C-3 and C-5 of the DHP ring. In addition nitroimidazole ring is substitutes at C-4 position. These asymmetric analogues were synthesized by a modified Hantzsh reaction using procedure reported by Meyer. The in vitro anti-tubercular activity of compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated. The results indicate that the compounds containing aromatic esters are more potent than alkyl ones. The most potent aromatic compound (R=3-phenylpropyl) exhibits comparable anti-tubercular activity (MIC=1 micromol/ml) with reference compound isoniazide (INH) (MIC=1 micromol/ml). Conformational analysis, SAR studies of these compounds showed that increasing in lipophilicity and rotable bonds of these compounds resulted in increasing anti-tubercular activity."

The substrates interact with the calixresorcinarene through insertion of the aromatic ring into the cavity. Most of the substrates are analyzed as cationic species, although one anionic species is analyzed. All of the substrates exhibit enantiomeric discrimination in the 1H-NMR spectrum with one or more of the calixresorcinarenes. In most cases, the hydroxyproline derivatives are more effective at causing enantiodifferentiation than the corresponding proline derivative. Presumably, the hydroxyl group on the proline moieties is involved in interactions with the substituent groups of the substrate that are important in creating chiral recognition.

The shift of the characteristic IR band of the PT ring and the emergence of two charge transfer bands at 254nm and 246nm in UV difference spectra show the presence of pi-pi complexation between folic acid and anthracene.

Initial screens suggested that isolates in the Roseobacter lineage can degrade aromatic compounds via the beta-ketoadipate pathway, a catabolic route that has been well characterized in soil microbes. Six Roseobacter isolates were screened for the presence of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, a key enzyme in the beta-ketoadipate pathway. All six isolates were capable of growth on at least three of the eight aromatic monomers presented (anthranilate, benzoate, p-hydroxybenzoate, salicylate, vanillate, ferulate, protocatechuate, and coumarate). Four of the Roseobacter group isolates had inducible protocatechuate 3, 4-dioxygenase activity in cell extracts when grown on p-hydroxybenzoate. The pcaGH genes encoding this ring cleavage enzyme were cloned and sequenced from two isolates, Sagittula stellata E-37 and isolate Y3F, and in both cases the genes could be expressed in Escherichia coli to yield dioxygenase activity. Additional genes involved in the protocatechuate branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway (pcaC, pcaQ, and pobA) were found to cluster with pcaGH in these two isolates. Pairwise sequence analysis of the pca genes revealed greater similarity between the two Roseobacter group isolates than between genes from either Roseobacter strain and soil bacteria. A degenerate PCR primer set targeting a conserved region within PcaH successfully amplified a fragment of pcaH from two additional Roseobacter group isolates, and Southern hybridization indicated the presence of pcaH in the remaining two isolates. This evidence of protocatechuate 3, 4-dioxygenase and the beta-ketoadipate pathway was found in all six Roseobacter isolates, suggesting widespread abilities to degrade aromatic compounds in this marine lineage."

We find that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) reduces c-Myc expression in multiple prostate epithelial cell lines, including C4-2 cells, an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line. Reducing c-Myc expression to the levels observed after 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment resulted in a comparable decrease in proliferation and G(1) accumulation demonstrating that down-regulation of c-Myc is a major component in the growth-inhibitory actions of 1,25(OH)2D(3).

The formation of DHT from testosterone (5 alpha-reduction) was significantly greater in fibroblasts from genital skin than in those from nongenital skin in both males (2.15 +/- 1.43 vs 0.81 +/- 0.46 pmol/mg protein/h, mean +/- SD, P less than 0.001) and females (2.52 +/- 1.99 vs 0.69 +/- 0.18, P less than 0.01). Furthermore, DHT formation from 3 alpha-diol (3 alpha-HSOR oxidation) was also significantly greater in genital skin fibroblasts than in nongenital skin fibroblasts of males (5.47 +/- 3.37 vs 2.52 +/- 1.74 pmol/mg protein/h, P less than 0.01). However, the degradation of DHT to 3 alpha- and/or 3 beta-diol (3 alpha- and/or 3 beta-HSOR reductions) was not different between genital and nongenital skin fibroblasts of either males or females. Respective ratios of DHT formation to DHT degradation (5 alpha-reduction/3 alpha-HSOR reduction, 3 alpha-HSOR oxidation/3 alpha-HSOR reduction) were also significantly greater (P less than 0.002) in genital skin fibroblasts than in nongenital skin fibroblasts of males. On the other hand, both DHT formation and degradation were not different between male and female genital skin fibroblasts. These results suggest that the increased production of DHT in genital compared to nongenital skin results from increased 5 alpha-reduction and 3 alpha-HSOR oxidation."

Dissolved inorganic carbon, Fe(2+), VFA concentrations, and sulfate reduction were monitored in slurries from the oxidized (0-2 cm) and the reduced (5-9 cm) zone. In the 0-2 cm layer, 2/3 of the mineralization could be attributed to sulfate reduction and 1/3 to iron reduction. In the 5-9 cm layer, sulfate reduction was the sole mineralization process. Acetate and lactate turnover rates were measured by radiotracer. Inhibition of sulfate reduction with selenate resulted in the accumulation of acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate. The acetate turnover rates determined by radiotracer and accumulation after inhibition were similar. VFA turnover accounted for 21% and 52% of the mineralization through sulfate reduction in the 0-2 and 5-9 cm layer, respectively. Acetate and lactate turnover in the inhibited 0-2 cm slurry was attributed to iron reduction and accounted for 10% and 2% of the iron reduction. Therefore, 88% and 79% of the iron and sulfate reduction in the 0-2 cm layer, respectively, must be fueled by alternative e(-)-donors. The accumulation of VFA in the selenate-inhibited 0-2 cm slurry did not enhance iron reduction, indicating that iron reducers were not limited by VFA availability."

The kcat of aldehyde reduction by 3-APADPH was 2- to 4-fold lower than by NADPH. The dissociation constant of 3-APADPH from the enzyme-coenzyme complex was higher (77 microM) than that of NADPH (5.3 microM). Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on both kcat and kcat/Km for para-substituted benzaldehyde reduction by 3-APADPH (with the exception of para-carboxybenzaldehyde) were equal and on average 2.82 +/- 0.21, suggesting that these reactions follow a rapid equilibrium-ordered reaction scheme in which the hydride transfer step is rate-limiting. Multiple regression analysis of the data suggests that benzaldehyde reduction depends upon electronic substituent effects, characterized by a rho value of 0.5. These data are consistent with a transition state in which the charge on the aldehyde carbonyl increases relative to the charge on this group in the ground state. A positive deviation of para-carboxybenzaldehyde from the linear correlation between other benzaldehydes and the substituent constant sigma + suggests a specific interaction of the carboxyl substituent of the substrate with the enzyme."

Two pairs of 17-epimeric tetrahydro diols resulting from the stereoselective reduction of the delta 4- and 3-oxo groups and of the delta 1-function were characterized. The major diols were 17 alpha-methyl-5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol and 17 alpha-methyl-5 beta-androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol, which were both excreted in the conjugate fraction in a 1:3.8 ratio.

It was also demonstrated using synthetic 17 beta-sulfate conjugates of methandienone and 17 alpha-methyltestosterone that their corresponding 17-epimers are formed by nucleophilic substitution by water of the labile sulfate moiety. The steroidal metabolites were identified on the basis of their characteristic mass spectral features and by comparison with authentic reference standards.

The (n-3) fatty acid supplementation reduced IL-2 production in both groups; however, this reduction was significant only in older women. The PHA-stimulated mitogenic response was significantly reduced by (n-3) fatty acid in older women (36%). Thus, long-term (n-3) fatty acid supplementation reduced cytokine production in young women and cytokine production and T cell mitogenesis in older women. The reduction was more dramatic in older women than in young women. Although (n-3) fatty acid-induced reduction in cytokine production may have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, its suppression of IL-2 production and lymphocyte proliferation in older women may not be desirable."

This was further combined with TiO2 to fabricate a novel catalyst composite TiO2 -rGO-Re(PyBn)(CO)3 Cl for CO2 photo-reduction. This hybrid composite demonstrated high selectivity conversion of CO2 into CO under xenon-lamp irradiation. Compared with the unsupported homogeneous catalyst Re(PyBn)(CO)3 Cl, the covalent immobilized catalyst composite TiO2 -rGO-Re(PyBn)(CO)3 Cl enhanced the turnover number six times and significantly improved catalyst stability. During the process of CO2 photo-reduction, intermediate species with lifetimes longer than hundreds of microseconds were observed and the formation of CO products was revealed using timeresolved infrared spectroscopy. A plausible mechanism for CO2 photo-reduction by the TiO2 -rGO-Re(PyBn)(CO)3 Cl catalyst composite has been suggested. The obtained results have implications for the future design of efficient catalyst composites for CO2 photo-conversion. "

Current strength susceptibilities have been obtained by numerically integrating separately the diatropic and paratropic contributions to the current flow passing planes through chosen bonds of the molecules. The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2.

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine their affinity and selectivity are correspondingly important. Herein, we have determined the relative strengths of intramolecular interactions between a series of monosaccharides and an aromatic ring close to the glycosylation site in an N-glycoprotein host. We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars. Galactose seems to make the weakest and allose the strongest sugar-aromatic interactions, with glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in between. The NMR solution structures of several of the monosaccharide-containing N-glycoproteins were solved to further understand the origins of the similarities and differences between the monosaccharide-aromatic interaction energies. Peracetylation of the monosaccharides substantially increases the strength of the sugar-aromatic interaction in the context of our N-glycoprotein host. Finally, we discuss our results in light of recent literature regarding the contribution of electrostatics to CH-\u03c0 interactions and speculate on what our observations imply about the absolute conservation of GlcNAc as the monosaccharide through which N-linked glycans are attached to glycoproteins in eukaryotes.

It has been suggested that they are important in protein folding and stability, and non-bonded potential energy calculations indicate that a typical aromatic-aromatic interaction has an energy of between -1 and -2 kcal/mol and contributes between -0.6 and -1.3 kcal/mol to protein stability. There is such an aromatic pair on the solvent-exposed face of the first alpha-helix of barnase, the small ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The edge of the aromatic ring of Tyr17 interacts with the face of that of Tyr13. The two residues have been mutated both singly and pairwise to alanine, and their free energies of unfolding determined by denaturation with urea.

This value is similar to that calculated from the change in surface-accessible area between the rings on the formation of the pair.

Damage has been demonstrated using a number of endpoints, including gene mutation, chromosome aberrations, sister-chromatid exchange, DNA-strand breaks, DNA repair and oncogene activation. Although the responses in mammalian cells are weak when compared to bacterial mutagenicity, heterocyclic aromatic amines are rodent carcinogens. Metabolic N-oxidation by cytochrome P450 is an initial activation step with subsequent transformation of the N-hydroxy metabolites to the ultimate mutagenic species by O-acetyltransferase or sulfotransferase. Major routes of detoxification include cytochrome P450-mediated ring oxidation followed by conjugation to glucuronic or sulfuric acid. Direct conjugation to the exocyclic amine group also occurs. Major reactions include N-glucuronidation and sulfamate formation."

The best pharmacophore model, Hypo1, which has the highest correlation coefficient (0.9911), consists of one hydrogen-bond acceptor, one hydrogen-bond donor, one hydrophobic aliphatic moiety and one ring aromatic feature. Hypo1 was validated by test set and cross-validation methods. And the specificity of Hypo1 to Aurora B inhibitors was examined with the use of selective inhibitors against Aurora B and its paralogue Aurora A. The results clearly indicate that Hypo1 can differentiate selective inhibitors of Aurora B from those of Aurora A, and the ring aromatic feature likely plays some important roles for the specificity of Hypo1. Then Hypo1 was used as a 3D query to screen several databases including Specs, NCI, Maybridge and Chinese Nature Product Database (CNPD) for identifying new inhibitors of Aurora B. The hit compounds were subsequently subjected to filtering by Lipinski's rule of five and docking studies to refine the retrieved hits, and some compounds selected from the top ranked hits have been suggested for further experimental assay studies."

Because of the concern of the resistance to most of the commonly used drugs displayed by the considered mycobacteria, most efforts have been done to introduce new anti-tubercular agents. Recent studies showed that 1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarbamoyl derivatives with lipophilic groups have significant anti-tubercular activity. In this study, we synthesized new derivatives of 1,4-dihydropyridines in which different alkyl and aryl esters and diethyl carbamoyl are substituted in C-3 and C-5 of the DHP ring. In addition nitroimidazole ring is substitutes at C-4 position. These asymmetric analogues were synthesized by a modified Hantzsh reaction using procedure reported by Meyer. The in vitro anti-tubercular activity of compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated. The results indicate that the compounds containing aromatic esters are more potent than alkyl ones. The most potent aromatic compound (R=3-phenylpropyl) exhibits comparable anti-tubercular activity (MIC=1 micromol/ml) with reference compound isoniazide (INH) (MIC=1 micromol/ml). Conformational analysis, SAR studies of these compounds showed that increasing in lipophilicity and rotable bonds of these compounds resulted in increasing anti-tubercular activity."

In the present study, the functional role of Ca(2+)-binding site IV of akazara scallop (Chlamys nipponensis akazara) TnC in Ca(2+)-regulation was investigated using a site-directed mutant with an inactivated site IV (TnC-ZEQ), N- and C-terminal half molecule mutants (TnC(N) and TnC(C)), and wild-type TnC (TnC(W)). Equilibrium dialysis using (45)Ca(2+) demonstrated that TnC(W) and TnC(C) bind 0.6-0.8 mol of Ca(2+)/mol, but that TnC-ZEQ and TnC(N) bind virtually no Ca(2+). The UV difference spectra of TnC(W) and TnC(C) showed bands at around 280-290 nm due to the perturbation of Tyr and Trp upon Ca(2+)-binding, while TnC-ZEQ and TnC(N) did not show these bands. In addition, TnC(W) and TnC(C) showed retardation of elution from Sephacryl S-200 upon the addition of 1 mM CaCl(2), unlike TnC-ZEQ and TnC(N). These results indicate that Ca(2+) binds only to site IV and that Ca(2+)-binding causes structural changes in both the whole TnC molecule and the C-terminal half molecule. In addition, TnC(W), TnC-ZEQ, and TnC(C), but not TnC(N), were shown to form soluble complexes with scallop TnI at physiological ionic strength. On the other hand, the Mg-ATPase activity of reconstituted rabbit actomyosin in the presence of scallop tropomyosin was inhibited by scallop TnI and recovered by the addition of an equimolar amount of TnC(W), TnC-ZEQ, or TnC(C), but not TnC(N). These results imply that the site responsible for the association with TnI is located in the C-terminal half domain of TnC. Ternary complex constructed from scallop TnT, TnI, and TnC(W) conferred Ca(2+)-sensitivity to the Mg-ATPase of rabbit actomyosin to the same extent as native troponin, but the TnC(N)-TnT-TnI and TnC-ZEQ-TnT-TnI complexes conferred no Ca(2+)-sensitivity, while the TnC(C)-TnT-TnI complex conferred weak Ca(2+)-sensitivity. Thus, the major functions of scallop TnC, such as Ca(2+)-binding and interaction with TnI, are located in the C-terminal domain, however, the full Ca(2+)-regulatory function requires the presence of the N-terminal domain."

Ionic calcium (Ca(2+)) plays a central role in this coupling because it activates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during hormonal and electrical cell stimulation. To determine how mitochondrial dysfunction affects cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca(2+)/ATP handling, we performed life-cell quantification of these parameters in fibroblast cell lines derived from healthy subjects and patients with isolated deficiency of the first OXPHOS complex (CI). In resting patient cells, CI deficiency was associated with a normal mitochondrial ([ATP](m)) and cytosolic ([ATP](c)) ATP concentration, a normal cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)), but a reduced Ca(2+) content of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Furthermore, cellular NAD(P)H levels were increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was slightly depolarized, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were elevated and mitochondrial shape was altered. Upon stimulation with bradykinin (Bk), the peak increases in [Ca(2+)](c), mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](m)), [ATP](c) and [ATP](m) were reduced in patient cells. In agreement with these results, ATP-dependent Ca(2+) removal from the cytosol was slower.

To investigate this phenomenon, the functional characteristics of bovine cTnC (BcTnC) and that from rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, a cold water salmonid (ScTnC), have been compared. Rainbow trout maintain cardiac function at temperatures cardioplegic to mammals. To determine whether ScTnC is more sensitive to Ca(2+) than BcTnC, F27W mutants were used to measure changes in fluorescence with in vitro Ca(2+) titrations of site II, the activation site. When measured under identical conditions, ScTnC was more sensitive to Ca(2+) than BcTnC. At 21 degrees C, pH 7.0, as indicated by K(1/2) (-log[Ca] at half-maximal fluorescence, where [Ca] is calcium concentration), ScTnC was 2.29-fold more sensitive to Ca(2+) than BcTnC.

We investigated mechanistic aspects of oxidized LDL-induced superoxide production by human PMN, with special emphasis on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). Oxidized LDL, but not native LDL, evoked an early but sustained increase in [Ca(2+)](i) and a delayed production of superoxide. The increase in [Ca(2+)](i) could be reduced by fucoidan and completely prevented by U73122, suggesting involvement of the scavenger receptor and coupling to the phospholipase C signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the increase in [Ca(2+)](i) partly results from protein kinase C-dependent Ca(2+) influx. The relevance of this Ca(2+) entry for oxidized LDL-stimulated effects is illustrated by the finding that superoxide production was markedly reduced in the absence of external Ca(2+). Finally, inhibition of phagocytosis by cytochalasin B abolished oxidized LDL-stimulated superoxide production without affecting, however, the Ca(2+) mobilization. These effects of oxidized LDL on [Ca(2+)](i) and on respiratory burst of PMN may underlie the occurrence of elevated levels of [Ca(2+)](i) of resting PMN in hypercholesterolemia and represent a mechanism by which PMN can amplify processes in the early phase of atherosclerosis."

The starter diet based on corn and soybean meal, which is typical in the United States, is low in C(18:3), and the ratio of C(18:2) to C(18:3) is quite high relative to recommendations for human infants. Additionally, other functional fatty acids (C(20:4), C(20:5), C(22:6)) elongated from C(18:2) and C(18:3) have proven benefits in monogastric species. Thus, the effect of adding Ca salts of flax oil (high in C(18:3)) or fish oil (high in C(20:4), C(20:5), C(22:6)) to the starter diet of calves less than 3 mo old was investigated. In trial 1, 48 Holstein bull calves [43.2 +/- 1.4 kg of body weight (BW); 12/treatment] that were 2 to 3 d of age were fed 1 of 4 starter treatments containing A) no flax or fish oil (control), B) 0.125% Ca salt of flax oil, C) 0.250% Ca salt of flax oil, or D) 0.250% Ca salt of fish oil. Starters and water were fed free-choice to calves. During the first 56 d, calves were individually penned. From arrival until d 28, calves were fed a 26% crude protein, 17% fat milk replacer. From 56 to 84 d, calves were penned in groups of 6 and maintained on their same starter blended with 5% chopped grass hay. Trial 2 used 96 Holstein steer calves (66.3 +/- 3.11 kg of BW; 24/treatment) that were 59 to 60 d old in a 28-d trial. These calves had been managed for their first 56 d in the same way as the calves from trial 1 before starting trial 2. Trial 2 evaluated increasing concentrations of Ca salt of flax oil within a starter blended with 5% chopped grass hay and fed with water free-choice. The 4 treatments were A) 0%, B) 0.083%, C) 0.167%, and D) 0.250% Ca salt of flax oil. In trial 1, there were no differences among calves fed the control diet and calves fed the diet supplemented with flax oil.

Serum urea nitrogen and serum glucose concentrations decreased as flax oil increased in the diet. In trial 2, ADG and feed efficiency increased linearly as flax oil increased in the starter. Serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations increased as flax oil increased in the diet. Supplementing a Ca salt of fish oil had no effect on any variables measured. Supplementing C(18:3) (linolenic acid) as a Ca salt of flax oil to the corn and soybean meal-based diet of dairy calves less than 3 mo old resulted in increased ADG and feed efficiency."

Although sucralose does not enter \u03b2-cells nor acts as a substrate for glucokinase, it induces a marked elevation of intracellular ATP ([ATP]c). The present study was conducted to identify the signaling pathway responsible for the elevation of [ATP]c induced by sucralose. Previous studies have shown that sucralose elevates cyclic AMP (cAMP), activates phospholipase C (PLC) and stimulates Ca(2+) entry by a Na(+)-dependent mechanism in MIN6 cells. The addition of forskolin induced a marked elevation of cAMP, whereas it did not affect [ATP]c. Carbachol, an activator of PLC, did not increase [ATP]c. In addition, activation of protein kinase C by dioctanoylglycerol did not affect [ATP]c. In contrast, nifedipine, an inhibitor of the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel, significantly reduced [ATP]c response to sucralose. Removal of extracellular Na(+) nearly completely blocked sucralose-induced elevation of [ATP]c. Stimulation of Na(+) entry by adding a Na(+) ionophore monensin elevated [ATP]c. The monensin-induced elevation of [ATP]c was only partially inhibited by nifedipine and loading of BAPTA, both of which completely abolished elevation of [Ca(2+)]c. These results suggest that Na(+) entry is critical for the sucralose-induced elevation of [ATP]c. Both calcium-dependent and -independent mechanisms are involved in the action of sucralose. "

Rises in cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) elicited by single or repetitive action potentials (APs) propagated at a high speed (150 microm/s) in constant amplitude and rate of rise in the cytoplasm bearing ryanodine receptors, and then in the slower, waning manner in the deeper region. Ryanodine (10 microM), a ryanodine receptor blocker (and/or a half opener), or thapsigargin (1-2 microM), a Ca(2+)-pump blocker, or omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx, 1 microM), a N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, blocked the fast propagation, but did not affect the slower spread. Ca(2+) entry thus triggered the regenerative activation of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) in the submembrane region, followed by buffered Ca(2+) diffusion in the deeper cytoplasm. Computer simulation assuming Ca(2+) release in the submembrane region reproduced the Ca(2+) dynamics. Ryanodine or thapsigargin decreased the rate of spike repolarization of an AP to 80%, but not in the presence of iberiotoxin (IbTx, 100 nM), a BK-type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel blocker, or omega-CgTx, both of which decreased the rate to 50%. The spike repolarization rate and the amplitude of a single AP-induced rise in [Ca(2+)](i) gradually decreased to a plateau during repetition of APs at 50 Hz, but reduced less in the presence of ryanodine or thapsigargin. The amplitude of each of the [Ca(2+)](i) rise correlated well with the reduction in the IbTx-sensitive component of spike repolarization. The apamin-sensitive SK-type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current, underlying the afterhyperpolarization of APs, increased during repetitive APs, decayed faster than the accompanying rise in [Ca(2+)](i), and was suppressed by CICR blockers. Thus, ryanodine receptors form a functional triad with N-type Ca(2+) channels and BK channels, and a loose coupling with SK channels in bullfrog sympathetic neurons, plastically modulating AP."

In contrast, Ba(2+) current through a cloned brain isoform of the Ca(v)1.2 channel (rbC-II) was unaffected by PKC activation. Two potential sites of PKC phosphorylation are present at positions 27 and 31 in the cardiac form of Ca(v)1.2, but not in the brain form. Deletion of N-terminal residues 2-46 prevented PKC inhibition. Conversion of the threonines at positions 27 and 31 to alanine also abolished the PKC sensitivity of Ca(v)1.2. Mutant Ca(v)1.2 channels in which the threonines were converted singly to alanines were also insensitive to PKC modulation, suggesting that phosphorylation of both residues is required for PKC-dependent modulation. Consistent with this, mutating each of the threonines individually to aspartate in separate mutants restored the PKC sensitivity of Ca(v)1.2, indicating that a change in net charge by phosphorylation of both sites is responsible for inhibition. Our results define the molecular basis for inhibition of cardiac Ca(v)1.2 channels by the PKC pathway."

The resultant Ca(2+)/NT/bPEI1.8kDa NCs were approximately 10-25nm in size and had positive zeta-potentials, and their NT loading efficiency and content were approximately 60-75% and 10-20 wt%, respectively. Faster NT release from Ca(2+)/NT/bPEI1.8kDa NCs was induced by lower pH and by NTs with fewer phosphates. Reductions in cell viability in response to low temperature, serum deprivation, or hypoxia were recovered by NT delivery in Ca(2+)/NT/bPEI1.8kDa NCs. In a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced post-ischemic rat model, the BBB (blood brain barrier)-detoured intranasal administration of Ca(2+)/ATP/bPEI1.8kDa NCs induced a better reduction in infarct volume and neurological deficits than did free ATP. In conclusion, intracellular NT delivery using Ca(2+)/NT/bPEI1.8kDa NCs might potentially enhance cell survival and reduce infarction in energy-/oxygen-depleted environments."

Additionally, the role of the Na(+)-HCO(3)(-) symporter (NBS) was investigated. Adult rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to simulated ischemia and reoxygenation. Cytosolic pH [2', 7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)], Ca(2+) (fura 2), Na(+) [sodium-binding benzolfuran isophthatlate (SBFI)], and cell length were measured. NHE was inhibited with 3 micromol/l HOE 642 or 1 micromol/l 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), and NBS was inhibited with HEPES buffer. During anoxia in bicarbonate buffer, cells developed acidosis and intracellular Na and Ca (Na(i) and Ca(i), respectively) overload. During reoxygenation cells underwent hypercontracture (44.0 +/- 4.1% of the preanoxic length). During anoxia in bicarbonate buffer, inhibition of NHE had no effect on changes in intracellular pH (pH(i)), Na(i), and Ca(i), but it significantly reduced the reoxygenation-induced hypercontracture (HOE: 61.0 +/- 1.4%, EIPA: 68.2 +/- 1.8%). The sole inhibition of NBS during anoxia was not protective. We conclude that inhibition of NHE during anoxia protects cardiomyocytes against reoxygenation injury independently of cytosolic acidification and Ca(i) overload."

To investigate this phenomenon, the functional characteristics of bovine cTnC (BcTnC) and that from rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, a cold water salmonid (ScTnC), have been compared. Rainbow trout maintain cardiac function at temperatures cardioplegic to mammals. To determine whether ScTnC is more sensitive to Ca(2+) than BcTnC, F27W mutants were used to measure changes in fluorescence with in vitro Ca(2+) titrations of site II, the activation site. When measured under identical conditions, ScTnC was more sensitive to Ca(2+) than BcTnC. At 21 degrees C, pH 7.0, as indicated by K(1/2) (-log[Ca] at half-maximal fluorescence, where [Ca] is calcium concentration), ScTnC was 2.29-fold more sensitive to Ca(2+) than BcTnC.

We have previously clarified that exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) of a mouse melanoma cell culture medium causes rapid reduction of intracellular GSH levels, and that the GSH-MVK adduct can be detected by LC/MS analysis while the GSH-CA adduct is hardly detected. In the present study, to clarify why the GSH-CA adduct is difficult to detect in the cell medium, we conducted detailed investigation of the structures of the reaction products of ACR, CA, MVK and CSE in the GSH solution or the cell culture medium. The mass spectra indicated that in the presence of the cells, the GSH-CA and GSH-ACR adducts were almost not detected while their corresponding alcohols were detected. On the other hand, both the GSH-MVK adducts and their reduced products were detected. In the absence of the cells, the reaction of GSH with all \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyls produced only their corresponding adducts.

To elucidate the roles of Ca(2+) in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr(2+)-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 \u00c5, and compared it with the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn4CaO5-cluster relative to that of Ca(2+), resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca(2+), W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr(2+)-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 \u00c5 structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure."

Although recent studies suggest involvement of TTX-R Na(+) channels in sensory synaptic transmission and spinal pain processing, it remains unknown whether TTX-R Na(+) channels are expressed and function presynaptically. We examined expression of TTX-R channels at sensory synapses formed between rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord (SC) neurons in a DRG/SC co-culture system. Immunostaining showed extensive labeling of presynaptic axonal boutons with Na(v)1.8- and Na(v)1.9-specific antibodies. Measurements using the fluorescent Na(+) indicator SBFI demonstrated action potential-induced presynaptic Na(+) entry that was resistant to tetrodotoxin (TTX) but was blocked by lidocaine. Furthermore, presynaptic [Ca(2+)](i) elevation in response to a single action potential was not affected by TTX in TTX-resistant DRG neurons. Finally, glutamatergic synaptic transmission was not inhibited by TTX in more than 50% of synaptic pairs examined; subsequent treatment with lidocaine completely blocked these TTX-resistant excitatory postsynaptic currents.

Serum calcium (s-Ca) level significantly increased to 105.3% +/- 1.9% (P < 0.01 vs the basal value; mean +/- SD) from the basal value in the BEC group and to 104.4% +/- 2.7% (P < 0.01) in the CAC group at 3h post load. Urinary excretions of calcium (u-Ca/glomerular filtration rate, u-Ca/GF) after BEC and CAC load rose to 226.6% +/- 154.5% (P < 0.05) and 211.1% +/- 148.0% (P < 0.05), respectively. Serum phosphorus (s-P) levels after BEC load increased to 110.0% +/- 15.1% (P < 0.05), whereas that after CAC load showed no significant change (99.3% +/- 7.9%). On the other hand, urinary excretion of phosphorus (u-P/GF) after CAC load decreased to 60.0% +/- 32.4% (P < 0.01) and that in the BEC group showed no significant change (92.5% +/- 49.5%). The increase in s-Ca led to decrease in serum intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH) level [77.3% +/- 33.4% (P < 0.05) for BEC and 69.5% +/- 20.3% (P < 0.01) for CAC] although s-P was increased by the BEC load. The responses to BEC and CAC administration were compared in the younger and the older groups. The responses in the younger and the older group showed fundamentally the same trends and to the same extent. However, the changes in serum ionized calcium (i-Ca) and i-PTH levels at 1.5 h post load were significantly smaller in the older group than in the younger group (P < 0.01; P < 0.05). The increment in s-P level after BEC load in the older group was larger than that in the younger group. In conclusion, BEC can modulate not only calcium but also phosphorus metabolism in both younger and older subjects.

The source of Ca(2+) for the Ca(2+)-dependent exocytotic release of glutamate from astrocytes predominately comes from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores with contributions from both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- and ryanodine/caffeine-sensitive stores. An additional source of Ca(2+) comes from the extracellular space via store-operated Ca(2+) entry due to the depletion of ER stores. Here transient receptor potential canonical type 1 containing channels permit entry of Ca(2+) to the cytosol, which can then be transported by the store-specific Ca(2+)-ATPase to (re)fill ER. Mitochondria can modulate cytosolic Ca(2+) levels by affecting two aspects of the cytosolic Ca(2+) kinetics in astrocytes. They play a role in immediate sequestration of Ca(2+) during the cytosolic Ca(2+) increase in stimulated astrocytes as a result of Ca(2+) entry into the cytosol from ER stores and/or extracellular space. As cytosolic Ca(2+)declines due to activity of pumps, such as the smooth ER Ca(2+)-ATPase, free Ca(2+) is slowly released by mitochondria into cytosol. Taken together, the trinity of Ca(2+) sources, ER, extracellular space and mitochondria, can vary concentration of cytosolic Ca(2+) which in turn can modulate Ca(2+)-dependent vesicular glutamate release from astrocytes. An understanding of how these Ca(2+) sources contribute to glutamate release in (patho)physiology of astrocytes will provide information on astrocytic functions in health and disease and may also open opportunities for medical intervention."

To address these points, we evoked SR Ca(2+) release by rapid application of caffeine in indo 1-AM-loaded rabbit ventricular myocytes and measured caffeine-induced DADs (cDADs) with whole-cell current clamp. The SR Ca(2+) load of the myocyte was varied by different AP frequencies. The cDAD amplitude doubled for every 88+/-8 nmol/L of Delta[Ca(2+)](i) (simple exponential), and the Delta[Ca(2+)](i) threshold of 424+/-58 nmol/L was sufficient to trigger an AP. Blocking Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange current (I(Na/Ca)) by removal of [Na](o) and [Ca(2+)](o) (or with 5 mmol/L Ni(2+)) reduced cDADs by >90%, for the same Delta[Ca(2+)](i). In contrast, blockade of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (I(Cl(Ca))) with 50 micromol/L niflumate did not significantly alter cDADs. We conclude that DADs are almost entirely due to I(Na/Ca), not I(Cl(Ca)) or Ca(2+)-activated nonselective cation current. To trigger an AP requires 30 to 40 micromol/L cytosolic Ca(2+) or a [Ca(2+)](i) transient of 424 nmol/L. Current injection, simulating I(ti)s with different time courses, revealed that faster I:(ti)s require less charge for AP triggering. Given that spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release occurs in waves, which are slower than cDADs or fast I(ti)s, the true Delta[Ca(2+)](i) threshold for AP activation may be approximately 3-fold higher in normal myocytes. This provides a safety margin against arrhythmia in normal ventricular myocytes."

The current density calculations provide novel and unambiguous current pathways for the unusual molecules with annelated aromatic and antiaromatic hydrocarbon moieties. The calculations show that the benzene and naphthalene moieties annelated with two pentalene units as in molecules 1 and 2, respectively, are unexpectedly antiaromatic sustaining only a local paratropic ring current around the ring, whereas a weak diatropic current flows around the C-H moiety of the benzene ring. For 1 and 2, the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are antiaromatic and a slightly weaker semilocal paratropic current flows around the two pentalene rings. Molecules 1 and 2 do not sustain any net global ring current. The naphthalene moiety of the molecule consisting of a naphthalene annelated with two pentalene units (3) does not sustain any strong ring current that is typical for naphthalene. Instead, half of the diatropic current passing the naphthalene moiety forms a zig-zag pattern along the C-C bonds of the naphthalene moiety that are not shared with the pentalene moieties and one third of the current continues around the whole molecule partially cancelling the very strong paratropic semilocal ring current of the pentalenes. For molecule 3, the pentalene moieties and the individual five-membered rings of the pentalenes are more antiaromatic than for 1 and 2.

Catalyzed by In(OTf)3, 4-trifluoromethyl-p-quinol silyl ethers react with C-, N-, and S-nucleophiles, respectively, in a regiospecific 1,2-addition manner to generate the corresponding highly reactive electrophilic intermediates. Further reaction of the in-situ generated electrophiles with a C-nucleophile followed by spontaneous aromatization enables the construction of functionalized trifluoromethyl arenes. This three-component, double nucleophilic addition/aromatization reaction based on the pre-introduction of a trifluoromethyl group onto an \"aromatic to be\" carbon provides a divergent strategy for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated arenes under mild reaction conditions in a single operation.

D-erythro-Ceramides with a phenyl group in the sphingoid moiety and a short N-acyl chain were able to reverse the inhibitory effect of fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)), but not of D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), on accelerated axonal growth in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, we demonstrated that a ceramide analogue with an aromatic ring in the sphingoid moiety is recognized as a substrate by glucosylceramide synthase, which suggests that the observed biological effects are mediated by activation of the ceramide analogue via glucosylation. Introduction of a methyl, pentyl, fluoro, or methoxy substituent in the para position of the phenyl ring in the sphingoid moiety yielded partly active compounds. Likewise, substitution of the benzene ring for a thienyl group did not abolish the ability to reverse the inhibition of accelerated axonal growth by FB(1).

We have been interested in determining the structural and electronic features that may be useful in predicting the direct-acting mutagenic activity of nitro-PAHs in Salmonella typhimurium. In this study, a series of structurally related nitro-PAHs were used to determine the relationships among direct-acting mutagenicity, orientation of the nitro group, and reduction potential of the nitro group. The compounds consisted of isomeric mononitrated and dinitrated benzo[e]pyrenes, their derivatives, and other nitro-PAHs ranging from two to five aromatic-ring molecules in size. A general finding is that nitro-PAHs with their nitro substituent oriented perpendicular to the aromatic system exhibit either very weak or no direct-acting mutagenicity in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. However, if a nitro-PAH of this type has a relatively low first half-wave reduction potential, it may be direct-acting. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the first half-wave reduction potential and direct-acting mutagenicity is found only when the compounds are structurally similar. Consequently, the correlation cannot be made using nitro-PAHs with different molecular size. Nitro-PAHs having a perpendicular nitro orientation always have a higher (absolute value) first half-wave reduction potential than the isomer(s) with a parallel orientation. Perhaps due to electron-withdrawing by the second nitro group, dinitro-PAHs always have a lower first half-wave reduction potential than their mononitro analogues. These findings provide a useful molecular basis for interpreting and predicting the direct-acting mutagenicity of nitro-PAHs."

Therefore, understanding the factors that determine their affinity and selectivity are correspondingly important. Herein, we have determined the relative strengths of intramolecular interactions between a series of monosaccharides and an aromatic ring close to the glycosylation site in an N-glycoprotein host. We employed the enhanced aromatic sequon, a structural motif found in the reverse turns of some N-glycoproteins, to facilitate face-to-face monosaccharide-aromatic interactions. A protein host was used because the dependence of the folding energetics on the identity of the monosaccharide can be accurately measured to assess the strength of the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction. Our data demonstrate that the carbohydrate-aromatic interaction strengths are moderately affected by changes in the stereochemistry and identity of the substituents on the pyranose rings of the sugars. Galactose seems to make the weakest and allose the strongest sugar-aromatic interactions, with glucose, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and mannose in between. The NMR solution structures of several of the monosaccharide-containing N-glycoproteins were solved to further understand the origins of the similarities and differences between the monosaccharide-aromatic interaction energies. Peracetylation of the monosaccharides substantially increases the strength of the sugar-aromatic interaction in the context of our N-glycoprotein host. Finally, we discuss our results in light of recent literature regarding the contribution of electrostatics to CH-\u03c0 interactions and speculate on what our observations imply about the absolute conservation of GlcNAc as the monosaccharide through which N-linked glycans are attached to glycoproteins in eukaryotes.

However, the in situ redox status of OM c-Cyts during microbial metal reduction processes remain poorly understood. In this study, diffuse-transmission UV/Vis spectroscopy is used to investigate the in situ spectral reaction of Cr(VI) reduction by c-Cyts in intact Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cells under different incubation conditions. The reduced c-Cyts decreased transiently at the beginning and then recovered gradually over time. The Cr(VI) reduction rates decreased with increasing initial Cr(VI) concentrations, and Cr(III) was identified as a reduced product. The presence of Cr(III) substantially inhibited Cr(VI) reduction and the recovery of reduced c-Cyts, indicating that Cr(III) might inhibit cell growth. Cr(VI) reduction rates increased with increasing cell density. The highest Cr(VI) reduction rate and fastest recovery of c-Cyts were obtained at pH 7.0 and 30\u00b0C, with sodium lactate serving as an electron donor. The presence of O2 strongly inhibited Cr(VI) reduction, suggesting that O2 might compete with Cr(VI) as an electron acceptor in cells. This study provides a case of directly examining in vivo reaction properties of an outer-membrane enzyme during microbial metal reduction processes under non-invasive physiological conditions. "

The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics. The mutation of Y43L, however, did not induce a significant change in the crystal structure."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

Since then, there has been an ongoing debate about whether Hb allostery involves the unliganded tense T state and the liganded relaxed R state or whether it involves the T state and an ensemble of liganded relaxed states. In fact, the former model is inconsistent with many functional observations, as well as the recent discoveries of several relaxed-state Hb structures such as RR2, R3 and R2. One school of thought has suggested the R2 state to be the physiologically relevant relaxed end state, with the R state mediating the T-->R2 transition. X-ray studies have been performed on human carbonmonoxy Hb at a resolution of 2.8 A. The ensuing liganded quaternary structure is different from previously reported liganded Hb structures. The distal beta-heme pocket is the largest when compared with other liganded Hb structures, partly owing to rotation of betaHis63(E7) out of the distal pocket, creating a ligand channel to the solvent. The structure also shows unusually smaller alpha- and beta-clefts. Results from this study taken in conjunction with previous findings suggest that multiple liganded Hb states with different quaternary structures may be involved in ligand uptake, stabilization, transport and release."

The ER/Golgi quaternary complex is remarkably similar to the synaptic complex, suggesting that a common pattern is followed at all transport steps, where three Q-helices assemble to form a high affinity binding site for a fourth R-helix on an opposing membrane. Interestingly, although sec22b binds to the combination of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, it can only bind if it is present while the others assemble; sec22b cannot bind to a pre-assembled ternary complex of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1.

The crystallographic R-factor is 16.0%. The estimated error in atomic positions is 0.1 A overall, 0.14 A for main-chain atoms of internal segments, and 0.05 A for the iron atoms. The effects of intermolecular contacts on the structure were investigated; such contacts cause only highly localized distortions, as judged from the degree of molecular asymmetry that they induce. The geometry of the iron-nitrogen complex closely resembles that of the deoxymyoglobin structure of Takano (1977) and of the 5-co-ordinated model compounds of Hoard (1975) and Jameson et al. (1980). The distance of the iron from the mean plane of N(porphyrin) is 0.40(5) A and 0.36(5) A, respectively, at the alpha and beta haems, in contrast to the corresponding distance of +0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A in oxyhaemoglobin ( Shaanan , 1983); the Fe-N epsilon (F8) bond length is 2.12(4) A and the Fe-N(porphyrin) bond length is 2.06(2) A; the last is also in good agreement with extended X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurements on deoxyhaemoglobin ( Eisenberger et al., 1978; Perutz et al., 1982). The haems are domed toward the proximal side; the separation between the mean planes of N(porphyrin) and C(porphyrin) being 0.16(6) A and 0.10(6) A, respectively at the alpha and beta haems. At the alpha haems, the normals to the mean pyrrole planes are tilted uniformly toward the haem centre, by about three degrees relative to the haem normal, and there is a folding of about four degrees of the haem about an axis running between the methene carbons that are between the pyrrole rings bearing like-type side-chains. At the beta haems, there is no such folding, and only pyrroles II and IV (those eclipsed by His F8) are appreciably tilted, by about eight degrees. The independence of these parameters from restraints imposed on the model was verified by unrestrained refinement of the entire molecule starting from a structure with modified haem geometry."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

Dutch, English, German, Polish, and Spanish native listeners performed phoneme monitoring experiments with pseudowords containing either coherent or misleading formant transitions for the fricatives /s/ and /f/. Listeners of German and Dutch, both languages without spectrally similar fricatives, were not affected by the misleading formant transitions. Listeners of the remaining languages were misled by incorrect formant transitions. In an untimed labeling experiment both Dutch and Spanish listeners provided goodness ratings that revealed sensitivity to the acoustic manipulation. We conclude that all listeners may be sensitive to mismatching information at a low auditory level, but that they do not necessarily take full advantage of all available systematic acoustic variation when identifying phonemes. Formant transitions may be most useful for listeners of languages with spectrally similar fricatives."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

However, it is unclear whether bilinguals access phonotactic constraints from the non-target language during target language processing. For example, in Spanish, words with s+ consonant onsets cannot exist, and phonotactic constraints call for epenthesis (addition of a vowel, e.g., stable/estable). Native Spanish speakers may produce English words such as estudy (\"study\") with epenthesis, suggesting that these bilinguals apply Spanish phonotactic constraints when speaking English. The present study is the first to examine whether bilinguals access Spanish phonotactic constraints during English comprehension. In an English cross-modal priming lexical decision task, Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals heard English cognate and non-cognate primes containing s+ consonant onsets or controls without s+ onsets, followed by a lexical decision on visual targets with the /e/ phonotactic constraint or controls without /e/. Results revealed that bilinguals were faster to respond to /es/ non-word targets preceded by s+ cognate primes and /es/ and /e/ non-word targets preceded by s+ non-cognate primes, confirming that English primes containing s+ onsets activated Spanish phonotactic constraints. These findings are discussed within current accounts of parallel activation of two languages during bilingual spoken language comprehension, which may be expanded to include activation of phonotactic constraints from the irrelevant language.

Semantic constraints also eliminated the word-frequency effect of a larger N400 for low-frequency words. Responses to closed-class words exhibited reduced N400 amplitudes in syntactic and congruent sentences, indicating that formal sentence structure placed greater restrictions on closed-class words than it did on open-class words. However, unlike the open-class results, the impact of sentence context on closed-class words was stable across word positions, suggesting that these syntactic constraints were applied only locally.

By estimating equilibrium populations of structurally stable and unstable protofibrils, we determine the shift in the dominant population from free monomer to ordered fibril at a critical nucleus of ten chains for the C(2x) and C(2z) forms. We find that a minimum assembly of 16 monomer chains is necessary to mimic a mature fibril, and show that its structural stability correlates with a plateau in the hydrophobic residue density and a decrease in the likelihood of losing hydrophobic interactions by rotating the fibril subunits. While Abeta(1-40) protofibrils show similar structural stability for both C(2x) and C(2z) quaternary structures, we find that the fibril elongation propensity is greater for the C(2z) form relative to the C(2x) form. We attribute the increased propensity for elongation of the C(2z) form as being due to a stagger in the interdigitation of the N-terminal and C-terminal beta-strands, resulting in structural asymmetry in the presented fibril ends that decreases the amount of incorrect addition to the N terminus on one end. We show that because different combinations of stagger and quaternary structure affect the structural symmetry of the fibril end, we propose that differences in quaternary structures will affect directional growth patterns and possibly different morphologies in the mature fiber."

A mutation matrix, by its definition, is the exponential of a matrix with non-negative off-diagonal entries; this positivity requirement implies non-trivial constraints on the site-pattern frequency vectors. We call these additional constraints \"edge-parameter inequalities\". In this paper, we first motivate the edge-parameter inequalities by considering a pathological site-pattern frequency vector corresponding to a quartet tree with a negative internal edge. This site-pattern frequency vector nevertheless satisfies all of the constraints described up to now in the literature. We next describe two complete sets of edge-parameter inequalities for the group-based models; these constraints are square-free monomial inequalities in the Fourier transformed coordinates. These inequalities, along with the phylogenetic invariants, form a complete description of the set of site-pattern frequency vectors corresponding to bona fide trees. Said in mathematical language, this paper explicitly presents two finite lists of inequalities in Fourier coordinates of the form \"monomial < or = 1\", each list characterizing the phylogenetically relevant semialgebraic subsets of the phylogenetic varieties."

Using the DADAS90 program that calculates structures in dihedral angle space, 15 structures satisfying almost all constraints were obtained. The average root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the mean structure was 0.75 A for backbone atoms. The RMSD for backbone atoms between the representative NMR structure with the smallest constraint violation and crystal structures was within 1.2 A. Although the NMR and crystal structures thus resemble one another, a significant discrepancy was observed in a region termed 'basic protrusion.' The discrepancy observed in NMR experiments is explained by fluctuation in this region."

Since then, there has been an ongoing debate about whether Hb allostery involves the unliganded tense T state and the liganded relaxed R state or whether it involves the T state and an ensemble of liganded relaxed states. In fact, the former model is inconsistent with many functional observations, as well as the recent discoveries of several relaxed-state Hb structures such as RR2, R3 and R2. One school of thought has suggested the R2 state to be the physiologically relevant relaxed end state, with the R state mediating the T-->R2 transition. X-ray studies have been performed on human carbonmonoxy Hb at a resolution of 2.8 A. The ensuing liganded quaternary structure is different from previously reported liganded Hb structures. The distal beta-heme pocket is the largest when compared with other liganded Hb structures, partly owing to rotation of betaHis63(E7) out of the distal pocket, creating a ligand channel to the solvent. The structure also shows unusually smaller alpha- and beta-clefts. Results from this study taken in conjunction with previous findings suggest that multiple liganded Hb states with different quaternary structures may be involved in ligand uptake, stabilization, transport and release."

Purified recombinant syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, three Q-SNAREs, assemble cooperatively to create a high affinity binding site for sec22b, an R-SNARE. The syntaxin 5 amino-terminal domain potently inhibits SNARE complex assembly. The ER/Golgi quaternary complex is remarkably similar to the synaptic complex, suggesting that a common pattern is followed at all transport steps, where three Q-helices assemble to form a high affinity binding site for a fourth R-helix on an opposing membrane. Interestingly, although sec22b binds to the combination of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, it can only bind if it is present while the others assemble; sec22b cannot bind to a pre-assembled ternary complex of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1.

Quaternary amines (tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, and tetrapropylammonium, TMA, TEA, and TPA, respectively) did not inhibit PMCA. This is not to imply that PMCA is inherently selective against monovalent cations because guanidine and tetramethylguanidine inhibited PMCA by competing with Ca(2+). The divalent organic cation, ethyl diamine, inhibited PMCA but was not competitive with Ca(2+). In contrast, propyl diamine did compete with Ca(2+) and was about 10-fold more potent than butyl diamine in inhibiting PMCA. For the Na pump, both TEA and TPA inhibited, but TMA did not. TEA, guanidine, and tetramethylguanidine inhibition was competitive with Na(+) for ATPase activation and with K(+) for pNPPase activation, both of which are cytoplasmic substrate cation effects. Thus, these findings are consistent with TEA, guanidine, and tetramethylguanidine inhibiting from the cytoplasmic side of the Na pump; in contrast, we have previously shown that TPA did not inhibit from the cytoplasmic side. The divalent alkane diamines ethyl, propyl, and butyl diamine all inhibited the Na pump and all competed at the intracellular surface. The order of potency was ED > PD > BD consistent with an optimal size for binding; similarly, for the quaternary amines TMA is apparently too small to make appropriate contacts, and TPA is too large.

A dimeric variant (HHP2-RNase) of human pancreatic RNase, in which the enzyme has been engineered to reproduce the sequence of BSRNase helix-II (Gln28-->Leu, Arg31-->Cys, Arg32-->Cys, and Asn34-->Lys) and to eliminate a negative charge on the surface (Glu111-->Gly), is also extremely cytotoxic. Surprisingly, this activity is associated also to the unswapped form of the protein. The crystal structure reveals that on this molecule the hinge regions, which are highly disordered in the unswapped form of BSRNase, adopt a very well-defined conformation in both subunits. The results suggest that the two hinge peptides and the two Leu28 side chains may provide an anchorage to a transient noncovalent dimer, which maintains Cys31 and Cys32 of the two subunits in proximity, thus stabilizing a quaternary structure, similar to that found for the noncovalent swapped dimer of BSRNase, that allows the molecule to escape RI and/or to enhance the formation of the interchain disulfides."

The active site residue His(10), central in the catalytic mechanism of dPGM, is present as a phosphohistidine with occupancy of 0.28. The structural changes on histidine phosphorylation highlight various features that are significant in the catalytic mechanism. The C-terminal 10-residue tail, which is not observed in previous dPGM structures, is well ordered and interacts with residues implicated in substrate binding; the displacement of a loop adjacent to the active histidine brings previously overlooked residues into positions where they may directly influence catalysis. E. coli dPGM, like the mammalian dPGMs, is a dimer, whereas previous structural work has concentrated on monomeric and tetrameric yeast forms. We can now analyze the sequence differences that cause this variation of quaternary structure."

            "article": "A comparison of the solution structure of the interleukin-8 dimer determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with that of the 2 A resolution X-ray structure, solved by molecular replacement using the solution structure as a starting model, is presented. At the monomer level the atomic root-mean-square difference between the two structures for residues 7 to 72 is approximately 1.1 A for the backbone atoms, approximately 1.6 A for all atoms, and approximately 1 A for all atoms of the internal residues. There are two main regions of difference in the monomer. In the X-ray structure residues 4 to 6 are well ordered and the charged groups of Glu4 of one subunit and Lys23' of the other are in close enough proximity to form an electrostatic interaction. In contrast, these residues are partially disordered in solution and the electrostatic interaction involving Glu4 is replaced by one between Glu29 of one subunit and Lys23' of the other. In the loop comprising residues 31 to 36, His33 accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide group of Gln8 in the solution structure, but donates a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl group of Glu29 in the X-ray structure. There is also a difference in the quaternary structure with regard to the relative orientation of the two subunits produced by a rigid body rotation about the C2 axis that alters the angle between the central beta-strands (formed by residues 23 to 29 of the 2 subunits) at the dimer interface, without breaking the symmetry. In the solution structure this angle has a value of 168 degrees, while in the X-ray structure the central strands are essentially flat, with an angle of 179 degrees. As a result, the separation between the two anti-parallel helices, which lie at an angle of about 60 degrees to the underlying beta-strands, is decreased from 14.8 A in the solution structure to 11.1 A in the X-ray structure. The quaternary structural difference is related to the different conformations of the N terminus and the 31 to 36 loop, both of which display different interactions with respect to the ends of the central beta-strands in the two structures. These findings indicate that interleukin-8 has the potential to undergo conformational transitions that may be of functional significance."

However the efficacy of ALA-PDT is sub-optimal for thicker tumours and improved ALA delivery and therapeutic response are required. We have investigated the conjugation of ALA to a second-generation dxcendrimer for enhancing porphyrin synthesis in vitro and in vivo in a murine tumour model using systemic i.p. administration. In vitro, the dendrimer was more efficient than ALA for porphyrin synthesis at low concentrations in good correlation with higher cellular ALA dendrimer accumulation. In vivo, the porphyrin kinetics from ALA exhibited an early peak between 3 and 4 h in most tissues, whereas the dendrimer induced sustained porphyrin production for over 24 h and basal values were not reached until 48 h after administration. Integrated porphyrin accumulation from the dendrimer and ALA, at equivalent molar ratios, was comparable showing that the majority of ALA residues were liberated from the dendrimer. The porphyrin kinetics appear to be governed by the rate of enzymatic cleavage of ALA from the dendrimer, which is consistent with in vitro results. ALA dendrimers may be useful for metronomic PDT, and multiple low-dose ALA-PDT treatments."

By estimating equilibrium populations of structurally stable and unstable protofibrils, we determine the shift in the dominant population from free monomer to ordered fibril at a critical nucleus of ten chains for the C(2x) and C(2z) forms. We find that a minimum assembly of 16 monomer chains is necessary to mimic a mature fibril, and show that its structural stability correlates with a plateau in the hydrophobic residue density and a decrease in the likelihood of losing hydrophobic interactions by rotating the fibril subunits. While Abeta(1-40) protofibrils show similar structural stability for both C(2x) and C(2z) quaternary structures, we find that the fibril elongation propensity is greater for the C(2z) form relative to the C(2x) form. We attribute the increased propensity for elongation of the C(2z) form as being due to a stagger in the interdigitation of the N-terminal and C-terminal beta-strands, resulting in structural asymmetry in the presented fibril ends that decreases the amount of incorrect addition to the N terminus on one end. We show that because different combinations of stagger and quaternary structure affect the structural symmetry of the fibril end, we propose that differences in quaternary structures will affect directional growth patterns and possibly different morphologies in the mature fiber."

Purified recombinant syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, three Q-SNAREs, assemble cooperatively to create a high affinity binding site for sec22b, an R-SNARE. The syntaxin 5 amino-terminal domain potently inhibits SNARE complex assembly. The ER/Golgi quaternary complex is remarkably similar to the synaptic complex, suggesting that a common pattern is followed at all transport steps, where three Q-helices assemble to form a high affinity binding site for a fourth R-helix on an opposing membrane. Interestingly, although sec22b binds to the combination of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, it can only bind if it is present while the others assemble; sec22b cannot bind to a pre-assembled ternary complex of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1.

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

By estimating equilibrium populations of structurally stable and unstable protofibrils, we determine the shift in the dominant population from free monomer to ordered fibril at a critical nucleus of ten chains for the C(2x) and C(2z) forms. We find that a minimum assembly of 16 monomer chains is necessary to mimic a mature fibril, and show that its structural stability correlates with a plateau in the hydrophobic residue density and a decrease in the likelihood of losing hydrophobic interactions by rotating the fibril subunits. While Abeta(1-40) protofibrils show similar structural stability for both C(2x) and C(2z) quaternary structures, we find that the fibril elongation propensity is greater for the C(2z) form relative to the C(2x) form. We attribute the increased propensity for elongation of the C(2z) form as being due to a stagger in the interdigitation of the N-terminal and C-terminal beta-strands, resulting in structural asymmetry in the presented fibril ends that decreases the amount of incorrect addition to the N terminus on one end. We show that because different combinations of stagger and quaternary structure affect the structural symmetry of the fibril end, we propose that differences in quaternary structures will affect directional growth patterns and possibly different morphologies in the mature fiber."

Because only the exocytic SNARE complexes have been characterized in detail, the structural features shared by SNARE complexes from different fusion steps are not known. We now describe the subunit structure, assembly, and regulation of a quaternary SNARE complex, which appears to mediate an early step in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport. Purified recombinant syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, three Q-SNAREs, assemble cooperatively to create a high affinity binding site for sec22b, an R-SNARE. The syntaxin 5 amino-terminal domain potently inhibits SNARE complex assembly. The ER/Golgi quaternary complex is remarkably similar to the synaptic complex, suggesting that a common pattern is followed at all transport steps, where three Q-helices assemble to form a high affinity binding site for a fourth R-helix on an opposing membrane. Interestingly, although sec22b binds to the combination of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, it can only bind if it is present while the others assemble; sec22b cannot bind to a pre-assembled ternary complex of syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1. Finally, we demonstrate that the quaternary complex containing sec22b is not an in vitro entity only, but is a bona fide species in living cells."

The crystallographic R-factor is 16.0%. The estimated error in atomic positions is 0.1 A overall, 0.14 A for main-chain atoms of internal segments, and 0.05 A for the iron atoms. The effects of intermolecular contacts on the structure were investigated; such contacts cause only highly localized distortions, as judged from the degree of molecular asymmetry that they induce. The geometry of the iron-nitrogen complex closely resembles that of the deoxymyoglobin structure of Takano (1977) and of the 5-co-ordinated model compounds of Hoard (1975) and Jameson et al. (1980). The distance of the iron from the mean plane of N(porphyrin) is 0.40(5) A and 0.36(5) A, respectively, at the alpha and beta haems, in contrast to the corresponding distance of +0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A in oxyhaemoglobin ( Shaanan , 1983); the Fe-N epsilon (F8) bond length is 2.12(4) A and the Fe-N(porphyrin) bond length is 2.06(2) A; the last is also in good agreement with extended X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurements on deoxyhaemoglobin ( Eisenberger et al., 1978; Perutz et al., 1982). The haems are domed toward the proximal side; the separation between the mean planes of N(porphyrin) and C(porphyrin) being 0.16(6) A and 0.10(6) A, respectively at the alpha and beta haems. At the alpha haems, the normals to the mean pyrrole planes are tilted uniformly toward the haem centre, by about three degrees relative to the haem normal, and there is a folding of about four degrees of the haem about an axis running between the methene carbons that are between the pyrrole rings bearing like-type side-chains. At the beta haems, there is no such folding, and only pyrroles II and IV (those eclipsed by His F8) are appreciably tilted, by about eight degrees. The independence of these parameters from restraints imposed on the model was verified by unrestrained refinement of the entire molecule starting from a structure with modified haem geometry."

Characterizations of spectroscopic properties of cytochromes bo and bd isolated from BL21 (DE3)/pLysS and BL21 (DE3)/pLysS/pTTQ18-cyoE after 4 h of the aerobic induction of haem O synthase (CyoE) showed the specific incorporation of haem O into the low-spin haem-binding site in both oxidases. We found that the resultant haem oo- and obd-type oxidase severely reduced the ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity due to the perturbations of the quinol oxidation site.

NADPH is generally available, in plants it is a direct product of photosynthesis, and oxygen is a largely ubiquitous electron acceptor, and the electron-transporting core of an FAD and two haems is the minimal required to pass electrons across the plasma membrane. These NOXs have been shown to be essential for diverse functions throughout the biological world and, lacking a clear mechanism of action, their effects have generally been attributed to free radical reactions. Investigation into the function of neutrophil leucocytes has demonstrated that electron transport through the prototype NOX2 is accompanied by the generation of a charge across the membrane that provides the driving force propelling protons and other ions across the plasma membrane. The contention is that the primary function of the NOXs is to supply the driving force to transport ions, the nature of which will depend upon the composition and characteristics of the local ion channels, to undertake a host of diverse functions. These include the generation of turgor in fungi and plants for the growth of filaments and invasion by appressoria in the former, and extension of pollen tubes and root hairs, and stomatal closure, in the latter. In neutrophils, they elevate the pH in the phagocytic vacuole coupled to other ion fluxes.

T(reg) cell differentiation and function are guided by the transcription factor Foxp3, and their deficiency due to mutations in Foxp3 results in aggressive fatal autoimmune disease associated with sharply augmented T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokine production. Recent studies suggested that Foxp3 regulates the bulk of the Foxp3-dependent transcriptional program indirectly through a set of transcriptional regulators serving as direct Foxp3 targets. Here we show that in mouse T(reg) cells, high amounts of interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4), a transcription factor essential for T(H)2 effector cell differentiation, is dependent on Foxp3 expression. We proposed that IRF4 expression endows T(reg) cells with the ability to suppress T(H)2 responses. Indeed, ablation of a conditional Irf4 allele in T(reg) cells resulted in selective dysregulation of T(H)2 responses, IL4-dependent immunoglobulin isotype production, and tissue lesions with pronounced plasma cell infiltration, in contrast to the mononuclear-cell-dominated pathology typical of mice lacking T(reg) cells. Our results indicate that T(reg) cells use components of the transcriptional machinery, promoting a particular type of effector CD4(+) T cell differentiation, to efficiently restrain the corresponding type of the immune response."

Some of those Foxp3(-) T cells adopt effector helper T cell (T(h)) functions, whereas some retain \"memory\" of previous Foxp3 expression, reacquiring Foxp3 upon activation. This minority \"unstable\" population exhibits flexible responses to cytokine signals, relying on transforming growth factor-beta to maintain Foxp3 expression and responding to other cytokines by differentiating into effector T(h) in vitro. In contrast, CD4(+)Foxp3(+)CD25(high) T cells are resistant to such conversion to effector T(h) even after many rounds of cell division.

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen.

This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

Most of these transcript mutations are clustered adjacent to GAGAG motifs and CT repeats-regions that are susceptible to transcript editing and/or molecular misreading. By contrast, no genomic mutations were identified. These results suggest the occurrence of mRNA editing and/or defective function of RNA polymerase in a subject with SLE. Mutant RI alpha transcripts are pathophysiolgically significant, for they can encode diverse, aberrant RI alpha isoforms, including truncated, dominant-negative subunits, resulting in deficient PKA-I activity. We propose that deficient PKA-I isozyme activity contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE by hindering effective signal transduction and impairing T cell effector functions."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin."

A randomized clinical trial in ophthalmology provides motivating background for the discussion. The bilateral design for this study has four sequence groups T:T, T:P, P:T, and P:P, respectively, for T as test treatment or P as placebo in the corresponding order for the left and right eyes. This article describes how to use the average of the separate Wilcoxon rank sum statistics for the left and right eyes for the overall comparison between T and P with the correlation between the two eyes taken into account. An extension of this criterion with better sensitivity to potential differences between T and P through reduction of the applicable variance has discussion in terms of a conceptual model with constraints for within-side homogeneity of groups with the same treatment and between-side homogeneity of the differences between T and P. Goodness of fit for this model can have assessment with test statistics for its corresponding constraints. Simulation studies for the conceptual model confirm better power for the extended test statistic with its full invocation than other criteria without this property. The methods summarized here are illustrated for the motivating clinical trial in ophthalmology, but they are applicable to other situations with the crossover design with four sequence groups for either two locations for two treatments at the same time for a patient or two successive periods for the assigned treatments for a recurrent disorder. This article also notes that the methods based on its conceptual model can have unsatisfactory power for departures from that model where the difference between T and P via the T:T and P:P groups is not similar to that via the T:P and P:T groups, as might occur when T has a systemic effect in a bilateral trial. For this situation, more robust test statistics have identification, but there is recognition that the parallel groups design with only the T:T and P:P groups may be more useful than the bilateral design with four sequence groups."

To clarify the functional importance of many observed lymphocyte properties, I ask: What properties would a cell have if one designed it according to the theory of optimal detection, with minimal regard for biological constraints? Sparse and reasonable assumptions about the statistics of available signals prove sufficient for deriving many features of the optimal functional structure, in an incremental and modular design. The use of one common formalism guarantees that all parts of the design collaborate to solve the detection task. Detection performance is computed at several stages of the design. Comparison between design variants reveals e.g. the importance of controlling the signal integration time. This predicts that an appropriate control mechanism should exist. Comparing the design to reality, I find a striking similarity with many features of T cells. For example, the formalism dictates clonal specificity, serial receptor triggering, (grades of) anergy, negative and positive selection, co-stimulation, high-zone tolerance, and clonal production of cytokines. Serious mismatches should be found if T cells were hindered by mechanistic constraints or vestiges of their (co-)evolutionary history, but I have not found clear examples. By contrast, fundamental mismatches abound when comparing the design to immune systems of e.g. invertebrates. The wide-ranging differences seem to hinge on the (in)ability to generate a large diversity of receptors."

However, it is unclear whether bilinguals access phonotactic constraints from the non-target language during target language processing. For example, in Spanish, words with s+ consonant onsets cannot exist, and phonotactic constraints call for epenthesis (addition of a vowel, e.g., stable/estable). Native Spanish speakers may produce English words such as estudy (\"study\") with epenthesis, suggesting that these bilinguals apply Spanish phonotactic constraints when speaking English. The present study is the first to examine whether bilinguals access Spanish phonotactic constraints during English comprehension. In an English cross-modal priming lexical decision task, Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals heard English cognate and non-cognate primes containing s+ consonant onsets or controls without s+ onsets, followed by a lexical decision on visual targets with the /e/ phonotactic constraint or controls without /e/. Results revealed that bilinguals were faster to respond to /es/ non-word targets preceded by s+ cognate primes and /es/ and /e/ non-word targets preceded by s+ non-cognate primes, confirming that English primes containing s+ onsets activated Spanish phonotactic constraints. These findings are discussed within current accounts of parallel activation of two languages during bilingual spoken language comprehension, which may be expanded to include activation of phonotactic constraints from the irrelevant language.

Semantic constraints also eliminated the word-frequency effect of a larger N400 for low-frequency words. Responses to closed-class words exhibited reduced N400 amplitudes in syntactic and congruent sentences, indicating that formal sentence structure placed greater restrictions on closed-class words than it did on open-class words. However, unlike the open-class results, the impact of sentence context on closed-class words was stable across word positions, suggesting that these syntactic constraints were applied only locally. A second ERP component, distinct from the N400, was elicited primarily by congruent closed-class words."

A mutation matrix, by its definition, is the exponential of a matrix with non-negative off-diagonal entries; this positivity requirement implies non-trivial constraints on the site-pattern frequency vectors.

In this paper, we first motivate the edge-parameter inequalities by considering a pathological site-pattern frequency vector corresponding to a quartet tree with a negative internal edge. This site-pattern frequency vector nevertheless satisfies all of the constraints described up to now in the literature. We next describe two complete sets of edge-parameter inequalities for the group-based models; these constraints are square-free monomial inequalities in the Fourier transformed coordinates. These inequalities, along with the phylogenetic invariants, form a complete description of the set of site-pattern frequency vectors corresponding to bona fide trees. Said in mathematical language, this paper explicitly presents two finite lists of inequalities in Fourier coordinates of the form \"monomial < or = 1\", each list characterizing the phylogenetically relevant semialgebraic subsets of the phylogenetic varieties."

The RMSD for backbone atoms between the representative NMR structure with the smallest constraint violation and crystal structures was within 1.2 A.

NUP214-ABL1 and EML1-ABL1 display constitutive kinase activity and are sensitive to the kinase inhibitor imatinib. Both proteins transform hematopoietic cells and we established mouse models of EML1-ABL1 and NUP214-ABL1 induced T-ALL. Interestingly, whereas EML1-ABL1 activity requires homo-oligomerization via its coiled coil domain, activity of NUP214-ABL1 depends on its cellular localization to the nuclear pore complexes. These results for NUP214-ABL1 delineate a novel mechanism for fusion kinase activation in cancer and provide new options to interfere with NUP214-ABL1 activity. T-ALL development requires accumulation of different mutations. Little is known about the cooperation between the mutations and about their sequence of accumulation. We provide evidence that tyrosine kinase mutations occur late in T-ALL development, suggesting limited potential for kinase inhibitor monotherapy. We therefore combined NUP214-ABL1 inhibition with other therapies and show that inhibition of NUP214-ABL1 and NOTCH1 in vitro can result in synergistic effects. Further validation of these and other combination therapies requires animal models containing several of the mutations in T-ALL and thus reflecting the multistep oncogenic process of human T-ALL genesis. The models for ABL1 fusion induced T-ALL will serve as starting point here."

Therefore, we assessed whether the serum D-dimer levels are related to the left atrial volume index (LAVI) or other vascular risk factors and also evaluated the association between the D-dimer levels and the initial stroke severity. Methods Ninety-eight consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke and non-valvular AF (NVAF) who were anticoagulation-na\u00efve were enrolled, and all patients were stratified into moderate-to-severe and mild neurologic deficit groups using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission.

Results The patients were classified into two groups according to the severity of the neurologic deficit. In a partial correlation coefficient analysis adjusted for confounding factors, an increase in the initial serum D-dimer levels was significantly associated with LAVI (r=0.286; p=0.027).

The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit).

In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

We find that both yeast and human Poleta extend from mismatched base pairs with a frequency of approximately 10(-3) relative to matched base pairs. In the absence of efficient extension of mismatched primer termini, the ensuing dissociation of Poleta from DNA may favor the excision of mismatched nucleotides by a proofreading exonuclease. Thus, we expect DNA synthesis by Poleta to be more accurate than that predicted from the fidelity of nucleotide incorporation alone."

Dimerization of CTLA-4 is required for the formation of high-avidity complexes with B7 ligands and for transmission of signals that attenuate T cell activation. We determined the crystal structure of the extracellular portion of CTLA-4 to 2.0 angstrom resolution. CTLA-4 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and displays a strand topology similar to Valpha domains, with an unusual mode of dimerization that places the B7 binding sites distal to the dimerization interface. This organization allows each CTLA-4 dimer to bind two bivalent B7 molecules and suggests that a periodic arrangement of these components within the immunological synapse may contribute to the regulation of T cell responsiveness."

We previously proposed a model of the alternative pathway C5 convertase in which the second C3b molecule binds covalently to the first C3b molecule bearing Bb, and the C5 molecule binds to each C3b molecule of the covalently linked C3b dimer, resulting in its appropriate presentation to the catalytic site on Bb. In the present study, we purified the covalently linked C3b dimer and reconstituted the C5 convertase with the C3b dimer and factors B and D to obtain evidence in support of this model. An insoluble glucan, OMZ-176, was incubated with human serum to activate the alternative pathway and to allow formation of the alternative C5 convertase on the surface of the glucan, and the glucan bearing the C5 convertase was then solubilized by incubation with glucosidases. In this way, the covalently linked C3b dimer was obtained in solution without using a detergent. The C3b dimer was then separated from enzymes, C3b monomer, C3b oligomer, and other materials by chromatographies. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the purified C3b dimer had intact alpha'-chains. Alternative pathway C5 convertase was reconstituted when the isolated C3b dimer was incubated with factors B and D. The presence of P enhanced C5 convertase formation threefold. These results support the notions that the formation of the covalently linked C3b dimer is a general phenomenon associated with activation of the alternative pathway and that the C3b dimer acts as a part of the C5 convertase."

The results predict that ammonia can catalyze the reaction as both a monomer and dimer, the latter being more efficient as it makes the reaction nearly barrierless. It has been shown that monomeric ammonia makes the process significantly faster compared with the water monomer (the rate constant being 10(4) to 10(5) times higher) as well as the water dimer (10-20 times faster). Dimeric ammonia has been shown to be a better catalyst than its monomeric counterpart (the rate constant being 10(3) to 10(4) times higher). Its efficiency as a catalyst was found to be close to that of formic acid. Owing to the fact that ammonia is present in the Earth's atmosphere at a significant trace level, it is expected to play a nontrivial, if not pivotal, role in atmospheric chemistry as a catalyst. "

However the efficacy of ALA-PDT is sub-optimal for thicker tumours and improved ALA delivery and therapeutic response are required. We have investigated the conjugation of ALA to a second-generation dxcendrimer for enhancing porphyrin synthesis in vitro and in vivo in a murine tumour model using systemic i.p. administration. In vitro, the dendrimer was more efficient than ALA for porphyrin synthesis at low concentrations in good correlation with higher cellular ALA dendrimer accumulation. In vivo, the porphyrin kinetics from ALA exhibited an early peak between 3 and 4 h in most tissues, whereas the dendrimer induced sustained porphyrin production for over 24 h and basal values were not reached until 48 h after administration. Integrated porphyrin accumulation from the dendrimer and ALA, at equivalent molar ratios, was comparable showing that the majority of ALA residues were liberated from the dendrimer. The porphyrin kinetics appear to be governed by the rate of enzymatic cleavage of ALA from the dendrimer, which is consistent with in vitro results. ALA dendrimers may be useful for metronomic PDT, and multiple low-dose ALA-PDT treatments."

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine.

T(reg) cell differentiation and function are guided by the transcription factor Foxp3, and their deficiency due to mutations in Foxp3 results in aggressive fatal autoimmune disease associated with sharply augmented T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokine production. Recent studies suggested that Foxp3 regulates the bulk of the Foxp3-dependent transcriptional program indirectly through a set of transcriptional regulators serving as direct Foxp3 targets. Here we show that in mouse T(reg) cells, high amounts of interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4), a transcription factor essential for T(H)2 effector cell differentiation, is dependent on Foxp3 expression. We proposed that IRF4 expression endows T(reg) cells with the ability to suppress T(H)2 responses. Indeed, ablation of a conditional Irf4 allele in T(reg) cells resulted in selective dysregulation of T(H)2 responses, IL4-dependent immunoglobulin isotype production, and tissue lesions with pronounced plasma cell infiltration, in contrast to the mononuclear-cell-dominated pathology typical of mice lacking T(reg) cells.

Here we report that, whereas the majority of natural CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells maintain stable Foxp3 expression after adoptive transfer to lymphopenic or lymphoreplete recipients, a minor fraction enriched within the CD25(-) subset actually lose it. Some of those Foxp3(-) T cells adopt effector helper T cell (T(h)) functions, whereas some retain \"memory\" of previous Foxp3 expression, reacquiring Foxp3 upon activation. This minority \"unstable\" population exhibits flexible responses to cytokine signals, relying on transforming growth factor-beta to maintain Foxp3 expression and responding to other cytokines by differentiating into effector T(h) in vitro. In contrast, CD4(+)Foxp3(+)CD25(high) T cells are resistant to such conversion to effector T(h) even after many rounds of cell division. These results demonstrate that natural Foxp3(+) T cells are a heterogeneous population consisting of a committed T(reg) lineage and an uncommitted subpopulation with developmental plasticity."

Memory T cells have a high turnover rate, and CD8(+) memory T cells proliferate upon viral infection, in the presence of IFN-alphabeta and/or IL-15. In this study, we extend these findings by showing that activated NKT cells and superantigen-activated T cells induce extensive bystander proliferation of both CD8(+) and CD4(+) memory T cells. Moreover, proliferation of memory T cells can be induced by an IFN-alphabeta-independent, but IFN-gamma- or IL-12-dependent pathway. In these conditions of bystander activation, proliferating memory (CD44(high)) T cells do not derive from activation of naive (CD44(low)) T cells, but rather from bona fide memory CD44(high) T cells.

Although both T(3) and T(4) stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, activated ERK1/2 did not contribute to T(3)-induced Src kinase or PI3-kinase activation, and an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, LY-294002, did not block activation of ERK1/2 by physiological concentrations of T(3) and T(4). Thus the PI3-kinase, Src kinase, and ERK1/2 signaling cascades are parallel pathways in T(3)-treated U-87 MG cells. T(3) and T(4) both caused proliferation of U-87 MG cells; these effects were blocked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD-98059 but not by LY-294002. Small-interfering RNA knockdown of PI3-kinase confirmed that PI3-kinase was not involved in the proliferative action of T(3) on U-87 MG cells. PI3-kinase-dependent actions of T(3) in these cells included shuttling of nuclear thyroid hormone receptor-alpha (TRalpha) from cytoplasm to nucleus and accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha mRNA; LY-294002 inhibited these actions. Results of studies involving alpha(v)beta(3) receptor antagonists tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide, together with mathematical modeling of the kinetics of displacement of radiolabeled T(3) from the integrin by unlabeled T(3) and by unlabeled T(4), are consistent with the presence of two iodothyronine receptor domains on the integrin. A model proposes that one site binds T(3) exclusively, activates PI3-kinase via Src kinase, and stimulates TRalpha trafficking and HIF-1alpha gene expression. Tetrac and RGD peptide both inhibit T(3) action at this site. The second site binds T(4) and T(3), and, via this receptor, the iodothyronines stimulate ERK1/2-dependent tumor cell proliferation. T(3) action here is inhibited by tetrac alone, but the effect of T(4) is blocked by both tetrac and the RGD peptide."

We report five experiments testing the hypothesis that listeners differ in their use of formant transitions as a function of the presence of spectrally similar fricatives in their native language. Dutch, English, German, Polish, and Spanish native listeners performed phoneme monitoring experiments with pseudowords containing either coherent or misleading formant transitions for the fricatives /s/ and /f/. Listeners of German and Dutch, both languages without spectrally similar fricatives, were not affected by the misleading formant transitions. Listeners of the remaining languages were misled by incorrect formant transitions. In an untimed labeling experiment both Dutch and Spanish listeners provided goodness ratings that revealed sensitivity to the acoustic manipulation. We conclude that all listeners may be sensitive to mismatching information at a low auditory level, but that they do not necessarily take full advantage of all available systematic acoustic variation when identifying phonemes. Formant transitions may be most useful for listeners of languages with spectrally similar fricatives."

However, it is unclear whether bilinguals access phonotactic constraints from the non-target language during target language processing. For example, in Spanish, words with s+ consonant onsets cannot exist, and phonotactic constraints call for epenthesis (addition of a vowel, e.g., stable/estable). Native Spanish speakers may produce English words such as estudy (\"study\") with epenthesis, suggesting that these bilinguals apply Spanish phonotactic constraints when speaking English. The present study is the first to examine whether bilinguals access Spanish phonotactic constraints during English comprehension. In an English cross-modal priming lexical decision task, Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals heard English cognate and non-cognate primes containing s+ consonant onsets or controls without s+ onsets, followed by a lexical decision on visual targets with the /e/ phonotactic constraint or controls without /e/. Results revealed that bilinguals were faster to respond to /es/ non-word targets preceded by s+ cognate primes and /es/ and /e/ non-word targets preceded by s+ non-cognate primes, confirming that English primes containing s+ onsets activated Spanish phonotactic constraints. These findings are discussed within current accounts of parallel activation of two languages during bilingual spoken language comprehension, which may be expanded to include activation of phonotactic constraints from the irrelevant language.

Semantic constraints also eliminated the word-frequency effect of a larger N400 for low-frequency words. Responses to closed-class words exhibited reduced N400 amplitudes in syntactic and congruent sentences, indicating that formal sentence structure placed greater restrictions on closed-class words than it did on open-class words. However, unlike the open-class results, the impact of sentence context on closed-class words was stable across word positions, suggesting that these syntactic constraints were applied only locally.

In this paper, we first motivate the edge-parameter inequalities by considering a pathological site-pattern frequency vector corresponding to a quartet tree with a negative internal edge. This site-pattern frequency vector nevertheless satisfies all of the constraints described up to now in the literature. We next describe two complete sets of edge-parameter inequalities for the group-based models; these constraints are square-free monomial inequalities in the Fourier transformed coordinates. These inequalities, along with the phylogenetic invariants, form a complete description of the set of site-pattern frequency vectors corresponding to bona fide trees. Said in mathematical language, this paper explicitly presents two finite lists of inequalities in Fourier coordinates of the form \"monomial < or = 1\", each list characterizing the phylogenetically relevant semialgebraic subsets of the phylogenetic varieties."

The RMSD for backbone atoms between the representative NMR structure with the smallest constraint violation and crystal structures was within 1.2 A.

NADPH is generally available, in plants it is a direct product of photosynthesis, and oxygen is a largely ubiquitous electron acceptor, and the electron-transporting core of an FAD and two haems is the minimal required to pass electrons across the plasma membrane. These NOXs have been shown to be essential for diverse functions throughout the biological world and, lacking a clear mechanism of action, their effects have generally been attributed to free radical reactions. Investigation into the function of neutrophil leucocytes has demonstrated that electron transport through the prototype NOX2 is accompanied by the generation of a charge across the membrane that provides the driving force propelling protons and other ions across the plasma membrane. The contention is that the primary function of the NOXs is to supply the driving force to transport ions, the nature of which will depend upon the composition and characteristics of the local ion channels, to undertake a host of diverse functions. These include the generation of turgor in fungi and plants for the growth of filaments and invasion by appressoria in the former, and extension of pollen tubes and root hairs, and stomatal closure, in the latter. In neutrophils, they elevate the pH in the phagocytic vacuole coupled to other ion fluxes. In endothelial cells of blood vessels, they could alter luminal volume to regulate blood pressure and tissue perfusion. "

Only about half of the sample had heard about screening mammography before the survey. However, when a simple explanation was given, 79 per cent expressed a favourable attitude toward it. Only 22 per cent of women thought of themselves as being personally susceptible to breast cancer; the proportion was lower in women over 60 than in those in their 40s. Morbid concern about breast cancer was rare. About a quarter of the sample expressed concern about mammographically induced exposure to radiation. Attitudes and perceptions of personal susceptibility were not associated with knowledge about risks of breast cancer. However, having a favourable attitude and a lack of concern about radiation were associated with previously having heard about screening mammography. Women speaking a language other than English at home and from households where the main income earner was in an unskilled occupation were least likely to have heard of screening mammography.

We previously proposed a model of the alternative pathway C5 convertase in which the second C3b molecule binds covalently to the first C3b molecule bearing Bb, and the C5 molecule binds to each C3b molecule of the covalently linked C3b dimer, resulting in its appropriate presentation to the catalytic site on Bb. In the present study, we purified the covalently linked C3b dimer and reconstituted the C5 convertase with the C3b dimer and factors B and D to obtain evidence in support of this model. An insoluble glucan, OMZ-176, was incubated with human serum to activate the alternative pathway and to allow formation of the alternative C5 convertase on the surface of the glucan, and the glucan bearing the C5 convertase was then solubilized by incubation with glucosidases. In this way, the covalently linked C3b dimer was obtained in solution without using a detergent. The C3b dimer was then separated from enzymes, C3b monomer, C3b oligomer, and other materials by chromatographies. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the purified C3b dimer had intact alpha'-chains. Alternative pathway C5 convertase was reconstituted when the isolated C3b dimer was incubated with factors B and D. The presence of P enhanced C5 convertase formation threefold. These results support the notions that the formation of the covalently linked C3b dimer is a general phenomenon associated with activation of the alternative pathway and that the C3b dimer acts as a part of the C5 convertase."

The D-dimer level is one of the surrogate markers for a hypercoagulable state and reflects thrombus formation in AF. Since the D-dimer level reflects hypercoagulability as well as thrombus and fibrin burdens, LAE could be associated with a D-dimer elevation. However, no studies have explored this association or which factors contribute to increases in the D-dimer levels in patients with AF. Therefore, we assessed whether the serum D-dimer levels are related to the left atrial volume index (LAVI) or other vascular risk factors and also evaluated the association between the D-dimer levels and the initial stroke severity. Methods Ninety-eight consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke and non-valvular AF (NVAF) who were anticoagulation-na\u00efve were enrolled, and all patients were stratified into moderate-to-severe and mild neurologic deficit groups using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission. The association between the initial serum D-dimer levels and the LAVI was evaluated in all enrolled patients, and the serum D-dimer levels were compared between the two groups. Results The patients were classified into two groups according to the severity of the neurologic deficit. In a partial correlation coefficient analysis adjusted for confounding factors, an increase in the initial serum D-dimer levels was significantly associated with LAVI (r=0.286; p=0.027). A linear regression analysis showed that a history of peripheral artery disease was the factor most strongly associated with the serum D-dimer level (t=3.90, p<0.001), followed by LAVI (t=2.37, p=0.021) and a history of congestive heart failure (t=2.16, p=0.035). The D-dimer levels were higher in the moderate-to-severe neurologic deficit group than in the mild deficit group, but this difference was not statistically significant (4.5\u00b17.1 vs. 1.6\u00b12.6 mg/L, p=0.068).

The FtsK gamma regulatory subdomain interacts with 8 bp KOPS DNA sequences, which are oriented from the replication origin to the terminus region (ter) in each arm of the chromosome. This interaction directs FtsK translocation towards ter where the final chromosome unlinking by decatenation and chromosome dimer resolution occurs. Chromosome dimer resolution requires FtsK translocation along DNA and its interaction with the XerCD recombinase bound to the recombination site, dif, located within ter. The frequency of chromosome dimer formation is approximately 15% per generation in wild-type cells. Here we characterize FtsK alleles that no longer recognize KOPS, yet are proficient for translocation and chromosome dimer resolution. Non-directed FtsK translocation leads to a small reduction in fitness in otherwise normal cell populations, as a consequence of approximately 70% of chromosome dimers being resolved to monomers. More serious consequences arise when chromosome dimer formation is increased, or their resolution efficiency is impaired because of defects in chromosome organization and processing. For example, when Cre-loxP recombination replaces XerCD-dif recombination in dimer resolution, when functional MukBEF is absent, or when replication terminates away from ter."

Therefore, we investigated the association of hemostatic factors with ischemic heart disease (IHD) in patients on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. The study patients comprised 30 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients and 18 hemodialysis patients. Twenty healthy subjects served as controls. We evaluated each subject's hemostatic factors, including factor VII, factor XII, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), fibrinogen, plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PIC), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and D-dimer. In dialysis patients, IHD was diagnosed by documented myocardial infarction or positive result on coronary angiogram or by positive thallium myocardial scintigraphy. Factor VII, fibrinogen, PIC, and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the two dialysis groups than in controls. All hemostatic variables were similar between the two dialysis groups. Subject age (p = 0.005), PIC (p = 0.005), and D-dimer level (p = 0.003) were significantly higher in patients with IHD than in patients without IHD in the dialysis groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only patient age and D-dimer levels were independent predictors of IHD. Adjusted odds ratio for IHD was 1.06 for each 10 ng/mL increase of D-dimer (p = 0.06). In CAPD patients, only D-dimer was independently associated with IHD (odds ratio: 1.06, p = 0.03). We conclude that multiple hemostatic abnormalities are present in dialysis patients and that elevated D-dimer levels are independently associated with prevalent IHD."

We have investigated the conjugation of ALA to a second-generation dxcendrimer for enhancing porphyrin synthesis in vitro and in vivo in a murine tumour model using systemic i.p. administration. In vitro, the dendrimer was more efficient than ALA for porphyrin synthesis at low concentrations in good correlation with higher cellular ALA dendrimer accumulation. In vivo, the porphyrin kinetics from ALA exhibited an early peak between 3 and 4 h in most tissues, whereas the dendrimer induced sustained porphyrin production for over 24 h and basal values were not reached until 48 h after administration. Integrated porphyrin accumulation from the dendrimer and ALA, at equivalent molar ratios, was comparable showing that the majority of ALA residues were liberated from the dendrimer. The porphyrin kinetics appear to be governed by the rate of enzymatic cleavage of ALA from the dendrimer, which is consistent with in vitro results.

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

An intriguing possibility is that these observed magnetic fields are a relic from the early universe, albeit one which has been subsequently amplified and maintained by a dynamo in collapsed objects. We review here the origin, evolution and signatures of primordial magnetic fields. After a brief summary of magnetohydrodynamics in the expanding universe, we turn to magnetic field generation during inflation and phase transitions. We trace the linear and nonlinear evolution of the generated primordial fields through the radiation era, including viscous effects. Sensitive observational signatures of primordial magnetic fields on the cosmic microwave background, including current constraints from Planck, are discussed. After recombination, primordial magnetic fields could strongly influence structure formation, especially on dwarf galaxy scales. The resulting signatures on reionization, the redshifted 21\u2009cm line, weak lensing and the Lyman-\u03b1 forest are outlined. Constraints from radio and \u03b3-ray astronomy are summarized. Astrophysical batteries and the role of dynamos in reshaping the primordial field are briefly considered. The review ends with some final thoughts on primordial magnetic fields."

However, it is unclear whether bilinguals access phonotactic constraints from the non-target language during target language processing. For example, in Spanish, words with s+ consonant onsets cannot exist, and phonotactic constraints call for epenthesis (addition of a vowel, e.g., stable/estable). Native Spanish speakers may produce English words such as estudy (\"study\") with epenthesis, suggesting that these bilinguals apply Spanish phonotactic constraints when speaking English. The present study is the first to examine whether bilinguals access Spanish phonotactic constraints during English comprehension. In an English cross-modal priming lexical decision task, Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals heard English cognate and non-cognate primes containing s+ consonant onsets or controls without s+ onsets, followed by a lexical decision on visual targets with the /e/ phonotactic constraint or controls without /e/. Results revealed that bilinguals were faster to respond to /es/ non-word targets preceded by s+ cognate primes and /es/ and /e/ non-word targets preceded by s+ non-cognate primes, confirming that English primes containing s+ onsets activated Spanish phonotactic constraints. These findings are discussed within current accounts of parallel activation of two languages during bilingual spoken language comprehension, which may be expanded to include activation of phonotactic constraints from the irrelevant language.

Semantic constraints also eliminated the word-frequency effect of a larger N400 for low-frequency words. Responses to closed-class words exhibited reduced N400 amplitudes in syntactic and congruent sentences, indicating that formal sentence structure placed greater restrictions on closed-class words than it did on open-class words. However, unlike the open-class results, the impact of sentence context on closed-class words was stable across word positions, suggesting that these syntactic constraints were applied only locally.

A mutation matrix, by its definition, is the exponential of a matrix with non-negative off-diagonal entries; this positivity requirement implies non-trivial constraints on the site-pattern frequency vectors. We call these additional constraints \"edge-parameter inequalities\". In this paper, we first motivate the edge-parameter inequalities by considering a pathological site-pattern frequency vector corresponding to a quartet tree with a negative internal edge. This site-pattern frequency vector nevertheless satisfies all of the constraints described up to now in the literature. We next describe two complete sets of edge-parameter inequalities for the group-based models; these constraints are square-free monomial inequalities in the Fourier transformed coordinates. These inequalities, along with the phylogenetic invariants, form a complete description of the set of site-pattern frequency vectors corresponding to bona fide trees. Said in mathematical language, this paper explicitly presents two finite lists of inequalities in Fourier coordinates of the form \"monomial < or = 1\", each list characterizing the phylogenetically relevant semialgebraic subsets of the phylogenetic varieties."

Using the DADAS90 program that calculates structures in dihedral angle space, 15 structures satisfying almost all constraints were obtained. The average root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the mean structure was 0.75 A for backbone atoms. The RMSD for backbone atoms between the representative NMR structure with the smallest constraint violation and crystal structures was within 1.2 A. Although the NMR and crystal structures thus resemble one another, a significant discrepancy was observed in a region termed 'basic protrusion.'

The collective behavior is believed to arise through communication by chemical signaling via the extracellular solution. We studied large, heterogeneous populations of discrete chemical oscillators (approximately 100,000) with well-defined kinetics to characterize two different types of density-dependent transitions to synchronized oscillatory behavior. For different chemical exchange rates between the oscillators and the surrounding solution, increasing oscillator density led to (i) the gradual synchronization of oscillatory activity, or (ii) the sudden \"switching on\" of synchronized oscillatory activity. We analyze the roles of oscillator density and exchange rate of signaling species in these transitions with a mathematical model of the interacting chemical oscillators."

In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

As nucleosomes are spaced close together within genomes, it is likely that on occasion they approach each other and may even collide. Here we have used a dinucleosomal model system to show that the 147-base-pair (bp) DNA territories of two nucleosomes can overlap extensively. In the situation of an overlap by 44 bp or 54 bp, one histone dimer is lost and the resulting complex can condense to form a compact single particle. We propose a pathway in which adjacent nucleosomes promote DNA unraveling as they approach each other and that this permits their 147-bp territories to overlap, and we suggest that these events may represent early steps in a pathway for nucleosome removal via collision."

In the present study, we purified the covalently linked C3b dimer and reconstituted the C5 convertase with the C3b dimer and factors B and D to obtain evidence in support of this model. An insoluble glucan, OMZ-176, was incubated with human serum to activate the alternative pathway and to allow formation of the alternative C5 convertase on the surface of the glucan, and the glucan bearing the C5 convertase was then solubilized by incubation with glucosidases. In this way, the covalently linked C3b dimer was obtained in solution without using a detergent. The C3b dimer was then separated from enzymes, C3b monomer, C3b oligomer, and other materials by chromatographies. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the purified C3b dimer had intact alpha'-chains. Alternative pathway C5 convertase was reconstituted when the isolated C3b dimer was incubated with factors B and D. The presence of P enhanced C5 convertase formation threefold. These results support the notions that the formation of the covalently linked C3b dimer is a general phenomenon associated with activation of the alternative pathway and that the C3b dimer acts as a part of the C5 convertase."

The D-dimer level is one of the surrogate markers for a hypercoagulable state and reflects thrombus formation in AF. Since the D-dimer level reflects hypercoagulability as well as thrombus and fibrin burdens, LAE could be associated with a D-dimer elevation. However, no studies have explored this association or which factors contribute to increases in the D-dimer levels in patients with AF. Therefore, we assessed whether the serum D-dimer levels are related to the left atrial volume index (LAVI) or other vascular risk factors and also evaluated the association between the D-dimer levels and the initial stroke severity. Methods Ninety-eight consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke and non-valvular AF (NVAF) who were anticoagulation-na\u00efve were enrolled, and all patients were stratified into moderate-to-severe and mild neurologic deficit groups using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission. The association between the initial serum D-dimer levels and the LAVI was evaluated in all enrolled patients, and the serum D-dimer levels were compared between the two groups. Results The patients were classified into two groups according to the severity of the neurologic deficit. In a partial correlation coefficient analysis adjusted for confounding factors, an increase in the initial serum D-dimer levels was significantly associated with LAVI (r=0.286; p=0.027). A linear regression analysis showed that a history of peripheral artery disease was the factor most strongly associated with the serum D-dimer level (t=3.90, p<0.001), followed by LAVI (t=2.37, p=0.021) and a history of congestive heart failure (t=2.16, p=0.035). The D-dimer levels were higher in the moderate-to-severe neurologic deficit group than in the mild deficit group, but this difference was not statistically significant (4.5\u00b17.1 vs. 1.6\u00b12.6 mg/L, p=0.068).

We have investigated the conjugation of ALA to a second-generation dxcendrimer for enhancing porphyrin synthesis in vitro and in vivo in a murine tumour model using systemic i.p. administration. In vitro, the dendrimer was more efficient than ALA for porphyrin synthesis at low concentrations in good correlation with higher cellular ALA dendrimer accumulation. In vivo, the porphyrin kinetics from ALA exhibited an early peak between 3 and 4 h in most tissues, whereas the dendrimer induced sustained porphyrin production for over 24 h and basal values were not reached until 48 h after administration. Integrated porphyrin accumulation from the dendrimer and ALA, at equivalent molar ratios, was comparable showing that the majority of ALA residues were liberated from the dendrimer. The porphyrin kinetics appear to be governed by the rate of enzymatic cleavage of ALA from the dendrimer, which is consistent with in vitro results.

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

However, it is unclear whether bilinguals access phonotactic constraints from the non-target language during target language processing. For example, in Spanish, words with s+ consonant onsets cannot exist, and phonotactic constraints call for epenthesis (addition of a vowel, e.g., stable/estable). Native Spanish speakers may produce English words such as estudy (\"study\") with epenthesis, suggesting that these bilinguals apply Spanish phonotactic constraints when speaking English. The present study is the first to examine whether bilinguals access Spanish phonotactic constraints during English comprehension. In an English cross-modal priming lexical decision task, Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals heard English cognate and non-cognate primes containing s+ consonant onsets or controls without s+ onsets, followed by a lexical decision on visual targets with the /e/ phonotactic constraint or controls without /e/. Results revealed that bilinguals were faster to respond to /es/ non-word targets preceded by s+ cognate primes and /es/ and /e/ non-word targets preceded by s+ non-cognate primes, confirming that English primes containing s+ onsets activated Spanish phonotactic constraints. These findings are discussed within current accounts of parallel activation of two languages during bilingual spoken language comprehension, which may be expanded to include activation of phonotactic constraints from the irrelevant language.

Semantic constraints also eliminated the word-frequency effect of a larger N400 for low-frequency words. Responses to closed-class words exhibited reduced N400 amplitudes in syntactic and congruent sentences, indicating that formal sentence structure placed greater restrictions on closed-class words than it did on open-class words. However, unlike the open-class results, the impact of sentence context on closed-class words was stable across word positions, suggesting that these syntactic constraints were applied only locally.

In this paper, we first motivate the edge-parameter inequalities by considering a pathological site-pattern frequency vector corresponding to a quartet tree with a negative internal edge. This site-pattern frequency vector nevertheless satisfies all of the constraints described up to now in the literature. We next describe two complete sets of edge-parameter inequalities for the group-based models; these constraints are square-free monomial inequalities in the Fourier transformed coordinates. These inequalities, along with the phylogenetic invariants, form a complete description of the set of site-pattern frequency vectors corresponding to bona fide trees. Said in mathematical language, this paper explicitly presents two finite lists of inequalities in Fourier coordinates of the form \"monomial < or = 1\", each list characterizing the phylogenetically relevant semialgebraic subsets of the phylogenetic varieties."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

In the present study, we purified the covalently linked C3b dimer and reconstituted the C5 convertase with the C3b dimer and factors B and D to obtain evidence in support of this model. An insoluble glucan, OMZ-176, was incubated with human serum to activate the alternative pathway and to allow formation of the alternative C5 convertase on the surface of the glucan, and the glucan bearing the C5 convertase was then solubilized by incubation with glucosidases. In this way, the covalently linked C3b dimer was obtained in solution without using a detergent. The C3b dimer was then separated from enzymes, C3b monomer, C3b oligomer, and other materials by chromatographies. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the purified C3b dimer had intact alpha'-chains. Alternative pathway C5 convertase was reconstituted when the isolated C3b dimer was incubated with factors B and D. The presence of P enhanced C5 convertase formation threefold.

The D-dimer level is one of the surrogate markers for a hypercoagulable state and reflects thrombus formation in AF. Since the D-dimer level reflects hypercoagulability as well as thrombus and fibrin burdens, LAE could be associated with a D-dimer elevation. However, no studies have explored this association or which factors contribute to increases in the D-dimer levels in patients with AF. Therefore, we assessed whether the serum D-dimer levels are related to the left atrial volume index (LAVI) or other vascular risk factors and also evaluated the association between the D-dimer levels and the initial stroke severity. Methods Ninety-eight consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke and non-valvular AF (NVAF) who were anticoagulation-na\u00efve were enrolled, and all patients were stratified into moderate-to-severe and mild neurologic deficit groups using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission. The association between the initial serum D-dimer levels and the LAVI was evaluated in all enrolled patients, and the serum D-dimer levels were compared between the two groups. Results The patients were classified into two groups according to the severity of the neurologic deficit. In a partial correlation coefficient analysis adjusted for confounding factors, an increase in the initial serum D-dimer levels was significantly associated with LAVI (r=0.286; p=0.027). A linear regression analysis showed that a history of peripheral artery disease was the factor most strongly associated with the serum D-dimer level (t=3.90, p<0.001), followed by LAVI (t=2.37, p=0.021) and a history of congestive heart failure (t=2.16, p=0.035).

This interaction directs FtsK translocation towards ter where the final chromosome unlinking by decatenation and chromosome dimer resolution occurs. Chromosome dimer resolution requires FtsK translocation along DNA and its interaction with the XerCD recombinase bound to the recombination site, dif, located within ter. The frequency of chromosome dimer formation is approximately 15% per generation in wild-type cells. Here we characterize FtsK alleles that no longer recognize KOPS, yet are proficient for translocation and chromosome dimer resolution. Non-directed FtsK translocation leads to a small reduction in fitness in otherwise normal cell populations, as a consequence of approximately 70% of chromosome dimers being resolved to monomers. More serious consequences arise when chromosome dimer formation is increased, or their resolution efficiency is impaired because of defects in chromosome organization and processing. For example, when Cre-loxP recombination replaces XerCD-dif recombination in dimer resolution, when functional MukBEF is absent, or when replication terminates away from ter."

In addition, abnormalities of coagulation and fibrinolysis have been reported in patients with uremia. However, whether these hemostatic abnormalities lead to cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients is currently unknown. Therefore, we investigated the association of hemostatic factors with ischemic heart disease (IHD) in patients on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. The study patients comprised 30 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients and 18 hemodialysis patients. Twenty healthy subjects served as controls. We evaluated each subject's hemostatic factors, including factor VII, factor XII, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), fibrinogen, plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PIC), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and D-dimer. In dialysis patients, IHD was diagnosed by documented myocardial infarction or positive result on coronary angiogram or by positive thallium myocardial scintigraphy. Factor VII, fibrinogen, PIC, and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the two dialysis groups than in controls. All hemostatic variables were similar between the two dialysis groups. Subject age (p = 0.005), PIC (p = 0.005), and D-dimer level (p = 0.003) were significantly higher in patients with IHD than in patients without IHD in the dialysis groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only patient age and D-dimer levels were independent predictors of IHD. Adjusted odds ratio for IHD was 1.06 for each 10 ng/mL increase of D-dimer (p = 0.06). In CAPD patients, only D-dimer was independently associated with IHD (odds ratio: 1.06, p = 0.03). We conclude that multiple hemostatic abnormalities are present in dialysis patients and that elevated D-dimer levels are independently associated with prevalent IHD."

We have investigated the conjugation of ALA to a second-generation dxcendrimer for enhancing porphyrin synthesis in vitro and in vivo in a murine tumour model using systemic i.p. administration. In vitro, the dendrimer was more efficient than ALA for porphyrin synthesis at low concentrations in good correlation with higher cellular ALA dendrimer accumulation. In vivo, the porphyrin kinetics from ALA exhibited an early peak between 3 and 4 h in most tissues, whereas the dendrimer induced sustained porphyrin production for over 24 h and basal values were not reached until 48 h after administration. Integrated porphyrin accumulation from the dendrimer and ALA, at equivalent molar ratios, was comparable showing that the majority of ALA residues were liberated from the dendrimer. The porphyrin kinetics appear to be governed by the rate of enzymatic cleavage of ALA from the dendrimer, which is consistent with in vitro results.

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin."

A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the \"quaternary-T constraints\", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta. In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface."

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

Three-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) was used to obtain 1,424 distance constraints between individually assigned polypeptide chain hydrogen atoms. Supplemental geometric constraints of 90phi angles and 12chi1 angles, and the distance constraints of 66 hydrogen bonds were experimentally derived. Using the DADAS90 program that calculates structures in dihedral angle space, 15 structures satisfying almost all constraints were obtained. The average root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the mean structure was 0.75 A for backbone atoms. The RMSD for backbone atoms between the representative NMR structure with the smallest constraint violation and crystal structures was within 1.2 A. Although the NMR and crystal structures thus resemble one another, a significant discrepancy was observed in a region termed 'basic protrusion.' The discrepancy observed in NMR experiments is explained by fluctuation in this region."

In the present study, we purified the covalently linked C3b dimer and reconstituted the C5 convertase with the C3b dimer and factors B and D to obtain evidence in support of this model. An insoluble glucan, OMZ-176, was incubated with human serum to activate the alternative pathway and to allow formation of the alternative C5 convertase on the surface of the glucan, and the glucan bearing the C5 convertase was then solubilized by incubation with glucosidases. In this way, the covalently linked C3b dimer was obtained in solution without using a detergent. The C3b dimer was then separated from enzymes, C3b monomer, C3b oligomer, and other materials by chromatographies. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the purified C3b dimer had intact alpha'-chains. Alternative pathway C5 convertase was reconstituted when the isolated C3b dimer was incubated with factors B and D. The presence of P enhanced C5 convertase formation threefold. These results support the notions that the formation of the covalently linked C3b dimer is a general phenomenon associated with activation of the alternative pathway and that the C3b dimer acts as a part of the C5 convertase."

The D-dimer level is one of the surrogate markers for a hypercoagulable state and reflects thrombus formation in AF. Since the D-dimer level reflects hypercoagulability as well as thrombus and fibrin burdens, LAE could be associated with a D-dimer elevation. However, no studies have explored this association or which factors contribute to increases in the D-dimer levels in patients with AF. Therefore, we assessed whether the serum D-dimer levels are related to the left atrial volume index (LAVI) or other vascular risk factors and also evaluated the association between the D-dimer levels and the initial stroke severity. Methods Ninety-eight consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke and non-valvular AF (NVAF) who were anticoagulation-na\u00efve were enrolled, and all patients were stratified into moderate-to-severe and mild neurologic deficit groups using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission. The association between the initial serum D-dimer levels and the LAVI was evaluated in all enrolled patients, and the serum D-dimer levels were compared between the two groups. Results The patients were classified into two groups according to the severity of the neurologic deficit. In a partial correlation coefficient analysis adjusted for confounding factors, an increase in the initial serum D-dimer levels was significantly associated with LAVI (r=0.286; p=0.027). A linear regression analysis showed that a history of peripheral artery disease was the factor most strongly associated with the serum D-dimer level (t=3.90, p<0.001), followed by LAVI (t=2.37, p=0.021) and a history of congestive heart failure (t=2.16, p=0.035). The D-dimer levels were higher in the moderate-to-severe neurologic deficit group than in the mild deficit group, but this difference was not statistically significant (4.5\u00b17.1 vs. 1.6\u00b12.6 mg/L, p=0.068).

The FtsK gamma regulatory subdomain interacts with 8 bp KOPS DNA sequences, which are oriented from the replication origin to the terminus region (ter) in each arm of the chromosome. This interaction directs FtsK translocation towards ter where the final chromosome unlinking by decatenation and chromosome dimer resolution occurs. Chromosome dimer resolution requires FtsK translocation along DNA and its interaction with the XerCD recombinase bound to the recombination site, dif, located within ter. The frequency of chromosome dimer formation is approximately 15% per generation in wild-type cells. Here we characterize FtsK alleles that no longer recognize KOPS, yet are proficient for translocation and chromosome dimer resolution. Non-directed FtsK translocation leads to a small reduction in fitness in otherwise normal cell populations, as a consequence of approximately 70% of chromosome dimers being resolved to monomers. More serious consequences arise when chromosome dimer formation is increased, or their resolution efficiency is impaired because of defects in chromosome organization and processing. For example, when Cre-loxP recombination replaces XerCD-dif recombination in dimer resolution, when functional MukBEF is absent, or when replication terminates away from ter."

The effects of intermolecular contacts on the structure were investigated; such contacts cause only highly localized distortions, as judged from the degree of molecular asymmetry that they induce. The geometry of the iron-nitrogen complex closely resembles that of the deoxymyoglobin structure of Takano (1977) and of the 5-co-ordinated model compounds of Hoard (1975) and Jameson et al. (1980). The distance of the iron from the mean plane of N(porphyrin) is 0.40(5) A and 0.36(5) A, respectively, at the alpha and beta haems, in contrast to the corresponding distance of +0.12(8) A and -0.11(8) A in oxyhaemoglobin ( Shaanan , 1983); the Fe-N epsilon (F8) bond length is 2.12(4) A and the Fe-N(porphyrin) bond length is 2.06(2) A; the last is also in good agreement with extended X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy measurements on deoxyhaemoglobin ( Eisenberger et al., 1978; Perutz et al., 1982). The haems are domed toward the proximal side; the separation between the mean planes of N(porphyrin) and C(porphyrin) being 0.16(6) A and 0.10(6) A, respectively at the alpha and beta haems. At the alpha haems, the normals to the mean pyrrole planes are tilted uniformly toward the haem centre, by about three degrees relative to the haem normal, and there is a folding of about four degrees of the haem about an axis running between the methene carbons that are between the pyrrole rings bearing like-type side-chains. At the beta haems, there is no such folding, and only pyrroles II and IV (those eclipsed by His F8) are appreciably tilted, by about eight degrees. The independence of these parameters from restraints imposed on the model was verified by unrestrained refinement of the entire molecule starting from a structure with modified haem geometry."

We have investigated the conjugation of ALA to a second-generation dxcendrimer for enhancing porphyrin synthesis in vitro and in vivo in a murine tumour model using systemic i.p. administration. In vitro, the dendrimer was more efficient than ALA for porphyrin synthesis at low concentrations in good correlation with higher cellular ALA dendrimer accumulation. In vivo, the porphyrin kinetics from ALA exhibited an early peak between 3 and 4 h in most tissues, whereas the dendrimer induced sustained porphyrin production for over 24 h and basal values were not reached until 48 h after administration. Integrated porphyrin accumulation from the dendrimer and ALA, at equivalent molar ratios, was comparable showing that the majority of ALA residues were liberated from the dendrimer. The porphyrin kinetics appear to be governed by the rate of enzymatic cleavage of ALA from the dendrimer, which is consistent with in vitro results.

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

However the efficacy of ALA-PDT is sub-optimal for thicker tumours and improved ALA delivery and therapeutic response are required. We have investigated the conjugation of ALA to a second-generation dxcendrimer for enhancing porphyrin synthesis in vitro and in vivo in a murine tumour model using systemic i.p. administration. In vitro, the dendrimer was more efficient than ALA for porphyrin synthesis at low concentrations in good correlation with higher cellular ALA dendrimer accumulation. In vivo, the porphyrin kinetics from ALA exhibited an early peak between 3 and 4 h in most tissues, whereas the dendrimer induced sustained porphyrin production for over 24 h and basal values were not reached until 48 h after administration. Integrated porphyrin accumulation from the dendrimer and ALA, at equivalent molar ratios, was comparable showing that the majority of ALA residues were liberated from the dendrimer. The porphyrin kinetics appear to be governed by the rate of enzymatic cleavage of ALA from the dendrimer, which is consistent with in vitro results. ALA dendrimers may be useful for metronomic PDT, and multiple low-dose ALA-PDT treatments."

The D-dimer level is one of the surrogate markers for a hypercoagulable state and reflects thrombus formation in AF. Since the D-dimer level reflects hypercoagulability as well as thrombus and fibrin burdens, LAE could be associated with a D-dimer elevation. However, no studies have explored this association or which factors contribute to increases in the D-dimer levels in patients with AF. Therefore, we assessed whether the serum D-dimer levels are related to the left atrial volume index (LAVI) or other vascular risk factors and also evaluated the association between the D-dimer levels and the initial stroke severity. Methods Ninety-eight consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke and non-valvular AF (NVAF) who were anticoagulation-na\u00efve were enrolled, and all patients were stratified into moderate-to-severe and mild neurologic deficit groups using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission. The association between the initial serum D-dimer levels and the LAVI was evaluated in all enrolled patients, and the serum D-dimer levels were compared between the two groups. Results The patients were classified into two groups according to the severity of the neurologic deficit. In a partial correlation coefficient analysis adjusted for confounding factors, an increase in the initial serum D-dimer levels was significantly associated with LAVI (r=0.286; p=0.027). A linear regression analysis showed that a history of peripheral artery disease was the factor most strongly associated with the serum D-dimer level (t=3.90, p<0.001), followed by LAVI (t=2.37, p=0.021) and a history of congestive heart failure (t=2.16, p=0.035). The D-dimer levels were higher in the moderate-to-severe neurologic deficit group than in the mild deficit group, but this difference was not statistically significant (4.5\u00b17.1 vs. 1.6\u00b12.6 mg/L, p=0.068).

The study patients comprised 30 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients and 18 hemodialysis patients. Twenty healthy subjects served as controls. We evaluated each subject's hemostatic factors, including factor VII, factor XII, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), fibrinogen, plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PIC), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and D-dimer. In dialysis patients, IHD was diagnosed by documented myocardial infarction or positive result on coronary angiogram or by positive thallium myocardial scintigraphy.

Adjusted odds ratio for IHD was 1.06 for each 10 ng/mL increase of D-dimer (p = 0.06). In CAPD patients, only D-dimer was independently associated with IHD (odds ratio: 1.06, p = 0.03).

In the present study, we purified the covalently linked C3b dimer and reconstituted the C5 convertase with the C3b dimer and factors B and D to obtain evidence in support of this model. An insoluble glucan, OMZ-176, was incubated with human serum to activate the alternative pathway and to allow formation of the alternative C5 convertase on the surface of the glucan, and the glucan bearing the C5 convertase was then solubilized by incubation with glucosidases. In this way, the covalently linked C3b dimer was obtained in solution without using a detergent. The C3b dimer was then separated from enzymes, C3b monomer, C3b oligomer, and other materials by chromatographies. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the purified C3b dimer had intact alpha'-chains. Alternative pathway C5 convertase was reconstituted when the isolated C3b dimer was incubated with factors B and D. The presence of P enhanced C5 convertase formation threefold. These results support the notions that the formation of the covalently linked C3b dimer is a general phenomenon associated with activation of the alternative pathway and that the C3b dimer acts as a part of the C5 convertase."

Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

We previously proposed a model of the alternative pathway C5 convertase in which the second C3b molecule binds covalently to the first C3b molecule bearing Bb, and the C5 molecule binds to each C3b molecule of the covalently linked C3b dimer, resulting in its appropriate presentation to the catalytic site on Bb. In the present study, we purified the covalently linked C3b dimer and reconstituted the C5 convertase with the C3b dimer and factors B and D to obtain evidence in support of this model. An insoluble glucan, OMZ-176, was incubated with human serum to activate the alternative pathway and to allow formation of the alternative C5 convertase on the surface of the glucan, and the glucan bearing the C5 convertase was then solubilized by incubation with glucosidases. In this way, the covalently linked C3b dimer was obtained in solution without using a detergent. The C3b dimer was then separated from enzymes, C3b monomer, C3b oligomer, and other materials by chromatographies. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the purified C3b dimer had intact alpha'-chains. Alternative pathway C5 convertase was reconstituted when the isolated C3b dimer was incubated with factors B and D. The presence of P enhanced C5 convertase formation threefold. These results support the notions that the formation of the covalently linked C3b dimer is a general phenomenon associated with activation of the alternative pathway and that the C3b dimer acts as a part of the C5 convertase."

The D-dimer level is one of the surrogate markers for a hypercoagulable state and reflects thrombus formation in AF. Since the D-dimer level reflects hypercoagulability as well as thrombus and fibrin burdens, LAE could be associated with a D-dimer elevation. However, no studies have explored this association or which factors contribute to increases in the D-dimer levels in patients with AF. Therefore, we assessed whether the serum D-dimer levels are related to the left atrial volume index (LAVI) or other vascular risk factors and also evaluated the association between the D-dimer levels and the initial stroke severity. Methods Ninety-eight consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke and non-valvular AF (NVAF) who were anticoagulation-na\u00efve were enrolled, and all patients were stratified into moderate-to-severe and mild neurologic deficit groups using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission. The association between the initial serum D-dimer levels and the LAVI was evaluated in all enrolled patients, and the serum D-dimer levels were compared between the two groups. Results The patients were classified into two groups according to the severity of the neurologic deficit. In a partial correlation coefficient analysis adjusted for confounding factors, an increase in the initial serum D-dimer levels was significantly associated with LAVI (r=0.286; p=0.027). A linear regression analysis showed that a history of peripheral artery disease was the factor most strongly associated with the serum D-dimer level (t=3.90, p<0.001), followed by LAVI (t=2.37, p=0.021) and a history of congestive heart failure (t=2.16, p=0.035). The D-dimer levels were higher in the moderate-to-severe neurologic deficit group than in the mild deficit group, but this difference was not statistically significant (4.5\u00b17.1 vs. 1.6\u00b12.6 mg/L, p=0.068). Conclusion The serum D-dimer levels were significantly associated with LAE in anticoagulation-na\u00efve patients with an acute ischemic stroke and NVAF. "

The FtsK gamma regulatory subdomain interacts with 8 bp KOPS DNA sequences, which are oriented from the replication origin to the terminus region (ter) in each arm of the chromosome. This interaction directs FtsK translocation towards ter where the final chromosome unlinking by decatenation and chromosome dimer resolution occurs. Chromosome dimer resolution requires FtsK translocation along DNA and its interaction with the XerCD recombinase bound to the recombination site, dif, located within ter. The frequency of chromosome dimer formation is approximately 15% per generation in wild-type cells. Here we characterize FtsK alleles that no longer recognize KOPS, yet are proficient for translocation and chromosome dimer resolution. Non-directed FtsK translocation leads to a small reduction in fitness in otherwise normal cell populations, as a consequence of approximately 70% of chromosome dimers being resolved to monomers. More serious consequences arise when chromosome dimer formation is increased, or their resolution efficiency is impaired because of defects in chromosome organization and processing. For example, when Cre-loxP recombination replaces XerCD-dif recombination in dimer resolution, when functional MukBEF is absent, or when replication terminates away from ter."

In addition, abnormalities of coagulation and fibrinolysis have been reported in patients with uremia. However, whether these hemostatic abnormalities lead to cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients is currently unknown. Therefore, we investigated the association of hemostatic factors with ischemic heart disease (IHD) in patients on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. The study patients comprised 30 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients and 18 hemodialysis patients. Twenty healthy subjects served as controls. We evaluated each subject's hemostatic factors, including factor VII, factor XII, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), fibrinogen, plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PIC), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and D-dimer. In dialysis patients, IHD was diagnosed by documented myocardial infarction or positive result on coronary angiogram or by positive thallium myocardial scintigraphy. Factor VII, fibrinogen, PIC, and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the two dialysis groups than in controls. All hemostatic variables were similar between the two dialysis groups. Subject age (p = 0.005), PIC (p = 0.005), and D-dimer level (p = 0.003) were significantly higher in patients with IHD than in patients without IHD in the dialysis groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only patient age and D-dimer levels were independent predictors of IHD. Adjusted odds ratio for IHD was 1.06 for each 10 ng/mL increase of D-dimer (p = 0.06). In CAPD patients, only D-dimer was independently associated with IHD (odds ratio: 1.06, p = 0.03). We conclude that multiple hemostatic abnormalities are present in dialysis patients and that elevated D-dimer levels are independently associated with prevalent IHD."

The S19 protein dimer caused chemotaxis via the receptor on monocytes to C5a, the complement C5-derived chemotactic factor. This dimer antagonized the C5a receptor on neutrophils. This dimer was released from apoptotic cells, and functioned in the phagocytic clearance of these cells by recruiting circulating monocytes.

In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface."

Twenty-four-hour treatment with DETA-NO resulted in a further reduction in NO responsiveness but no further reduction in phenylephrine responsiveness. Acute addition of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) had no effect on phenylephrine responsiveness in PA not treated with DETA-NO.

Cytokines typically produced in the xenograft environment (e.g., IL-1 and TNF) inhibit insulin biosynthesis and secretion from isolated pancreatic islets, and are associated with the production of nitric oxide (NO). To further define the relationship between NO production and islet xenotransplantation, the inhibition of NO in a splenocyte/islet coculture system, and the in vivo effect of this inhibition on canine islet xenotransplantation, was investigated. Splenocytes (SPLC) from Lewis rats were cocultured with canine islets (freshly isolated or cultured 7 days), supernatant removed, and NO concentration (NO2) determined by optical density (Griess reaction, 550 nm, expressed as nmol nitrite/10(6) cells/18 h). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as a positive control of SPLC production of NO. Stimulation by LPS resulted in maximal NO production (2.20 +/- 0.16 nmol/10(6) cells/18 h, p < 0.001 compared to baseline values of 0.73 +/- 0.04 nmol/10(6) cells/18 h). In the presence of NO inhibitors (NMA, polymyxin B, hydrocortisone, aminoguanidine, DMSO), nitrite levels did not significantly rise above unstimulated values. Freshly isolated canine islets did stimulate NO production (1.26 +/- 0.12 nmol/10(6) cells/18 h, p < 0.001). In contrast, cultured canine islets did not stimulate NO production (0.84 +/- 0.09 nmol/10(6) cells/18 h). Transplantation of freshly isolated canine islets to STZ-diabetic recipient Lewis rats resulted in amelioration of hyperglycemia in only 50% (n = 6) of recipients 12 h posttransplant, with a return to hyperglycemia at all subsequent time points. Transplantation of 7-day cultured canine islets resulted in amelioration of hyperglycemia in 88% of recipients 12 h posttransplant and 63% of recipients 24 h posttransplant [p = 0.028, mean survival time (MST) = 1.0 days, n = 8]. Transplantation of canine islet xenografts with aminoguanidine therapy (BID, n = 11) resulted in amelioration of hyperglycemia in 100% of recipients at 12 h posttransplant, decreasing to 82% by 24 h following transplantation (p = 0.002, MST = 0.9 days). These results demonstrate that freshly isolated canine islets are potent stimulators of NO production by rat SPLC in vitro, and that culture of canine islets, or addition of NO inhibitors, abrogates stimulated NO production. These results also demonstrate a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.001) in early function of canine islet xenografts following 7 days of islet culture prior to transplant, and following recipient treatment with aminoguanidine. These studies suggest that the production of NO in the microenvironment of the graft site may adversely affect engraftment and function of canine islets, and suggest that the abrogation of islet-stimulated NO production may improve engraftment following islet xenotransplantation."

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria.

From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity.

Postnatal day 7 rat pups were subjected to HI at 2 h (2-h IP), 6 h (6-h IP), or 22 h (22-h IP) after IP. We found all three IP groups had significantly reduced neuronal damage and TUNEL-(+) cells 24 h post-HI than no-IP group. Compared with control, the no-IP group had significant decreases of pCREB and mitochondria Bcl-2 levels in the ipsilateral cortex 24 h post-HI. In contrast, the three IP groups had increased pCREB and mitochondria Bcl-2 levels, and significant differences were found between three IP and no-IP groups. The increases of cleavage of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and of cells with nuclear apoptosis inducing factor post-HI in no-IP group were all significantly reduced in three IP groups. The increases of caspase-3 and calpain-mediated proteolysis of a-spectrin post-HI were significantly reduced only in 22-h IP group. Furthermore, all three IP groups had long-term neuroprotection at behavioral and pathological levels compared with no-IP group. In conclusion, IP, rapid, intermediate, or delayed, in neonatal rat brain activates CREB, up-regulates Bcl-2, induces extensive brakes on caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis after HI, and provides long-term neuroprotection."

Therefore, we examined the signaling cascade of PKC-elicited Nox activation and the role of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in mediating PKC-induced vascular contraction. Endothelium-denuded bovine coronary arteries showed a PKC-dependent basal production of lucigenin (5 muM)-detected Nox oxidase-derived superoxide, which was stimulated fourfold by PKC activation with 10 muM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). PDBu appeared to increase superoxide generation by Nox2 through both p47(phox) and peroxide-dependent Src activation mechanisms based on the actions of inhibitors, properties of Src phosphorylation, and the loss of responses in aorta from mice deficient in Nox2 and p47(phox). The actions of inhibitors of contractile regulating mechanisms, scavengers of superoxide and peroxide, and responses in knockout mouse aortas suggest that a major component of the contraction elicited by PDBu appeared to be mediated through peroxide derived from Nox2 activation stimulating force generation through Rho kinase and calmodulin kinase-II mechanisms. Superoxide generated by PDBu also attenuated relaxation to nitroglycerin. Peroxide-derived from Nox2 activation by PKC appeared to be a major contributor to the thromboxane A(2) receptor agonist U46619 (100 nM)-elicited contraction of coronary arteries. Thus a p47(phox) and Src kinase activation of peroxide production by Nox2 appears to be an important contributor to vascular contractile mechanisms mediated through activation of PKC."

In this study the hypothesis that NO might be a sensitive biomarker of stress in invertebrates has been tested. The spectrophotometric Griess assay for nitrite and nitrate has been modified so that the final breakdown products of NO are suitable for measurement in invertebrate haemolymph. The assay was linear in the range 1-100 microM with a sensitivity of 4 microM. The baseline NOx measurement in unstressed mussels was 0.74 mM NOx/mg protein. Mytilus edulis were kept at 15 micro C in filtered seawater for at least 2 days prior to exposure to TBTO (0.001-0.1 mg/l) for 24 h. Preliminary results suggest that TBTO perturbs the NO response and that the outlined assay protocol is a sensitive means of detecting those changes.

The cell death induced by rVvhA was independent of lysosomal permeabilizaton and caspase activation. rVvhA induced rapid phosphorylation of c-Src in the membrane lipid raft, which resulted in an increased interaction between lipid raft molecule caveolin-1 and NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex Rac1 for ROS production.

Cell damage and PKC carbonylation in response to treatment with CSE, ACR, or MVK are abolished by thiol-containing antioxidants such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine and reduced glutathione. Thus pharmacological modulation of PKC and NOX activities and the trapping of ROS are potential strategies for the prevention of diseases related to cigarette smoking. "

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm.

MauG is a novel 42 kDa di-heme protein, which is required for the biosynthesis of TTQ. An experimental system has been developed that allows the direct continuous monitoring of MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis in vitro. Four diverse electron donors, ascorbate, dithiothreitol, reduced glutathione, and NADH, were each able to provide reducing equivalents for MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis under aerobic conditions. The reaction with NADH was mediated by an NADH-dependent oxidoreductase. Under anaerobic conditions in the absence of an electron donor, H(2)O(2) could serve as a substrate for MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis. During the reaction with H(2)O(2), a discrete reaction intermediate was observed, which is likely the reduced quinol form of TTQ that then is oxidized to the quinone. These results suggest that not only the incorporation of oxygen into the monohydroxylated biosynthetic intermediate but also the subsequent oxidation of quinol MADH during TTQ biosynthesis is a MauG-dependent process. The implications of these results in elucidating the mechanism of MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis and identifying potential physiologic electron and oxygen donors for TTQ biosynthesis in vivo are discussed."

The addition of ilicicolin to the oxidized complex resulted in a non-linear inhibition of the extent of cytochrome b reduction by quinol together with a shift of the reduced b(H) heme spectrum, indicating electron transfer between monomers. The possibility of a fast exchange of ilicicolin between center N sites was excluded in two ways. First, kinetic modeling showed that fast movement of an inhibitor between monomers would result in a linear inhibition of the extent of cytochrome b reduction through center N. Second, we determined a very slow dissociation rate for ilicicolin (k = 1.2 x 10(-3) s(-1)) as calculated from its displacement by antimycin. Ilicicolin binding to the reduced bc(1) complex occurred in a single phase (k(on) = 1.5-1.7 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)) except in the presence of stigmatellin, where a second slower binding phase comprising approximately 50% of the spectral change was observed. This second kinetic event was weakly dependent on ilicicolin concentration, which suggests that binding of ilicicolin to one center N in the dimer transmits a slow (k = 2-3 s(-1)) conformational change that allows binding of the inhibitor in the other monomer. These results, together with the evidence for intermonomeric electron transfer, provide further support for a dimeric model of regulatory interactions between center P and center N sites in the bc(1) complex."

The inventory of epsilonproteobacterial genomes from 21 different species was analysed with respect to key enzymes involved in respiratory nitrogen metabolism. Most ammonifying Epsilonproteobacteria employ two enzymic electron transport systems named Nap (periplasmic nitrate reductase) and Nrf (periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase). The current knowledge on the architecture and function of the corresponding proton motive force-generating respiratory chains using low-potential electron donors are reviewed in this article and the role of membrane-bound quinone/quinol-reactive proteins (NapH and NrfH) that are representative of widespread bacterial electron transport modules is highlighted.

The molecular mechanisms for this process remain unknown, but current views suggest that the plastoquinone pool directly controls the activation of the kinase. On the basis of enzyme activation by a pH shift in the darkness combined with flash photolysis, EPR, and optical spectroscopy we propose that activation occurs when plastoquinol occupies the quinol-oxidation (Qo) site of the cytochrome bf complex, having its high-potential path components in a reduced state. A linear correlation between kinase activation and accessibility of the Qo site to plastoquinol was established by quantification of the shift in the g(y) EPR signal of the Rieske Fe-S center resulting from displacement of the Qo-site plastoquinol by a quinone analog. Activity persists as long as one plastoquinol per cytochrome bf is still available. Withdrawal of one electron from this plastoquinol after a single-turnover flash exciting photosystem I leads to deactivation of the kinase parallel with a decrease in the g(z) EPR signal of the reduced Rieske Fe-S center. Cytochrome f, plastocyanin, and P(700) are rereduced after the flash, indicating that the plastoquinol at the Qo site is limiting in maintaining the kinase activity. These results give direct evidence for a functional cytochrome bf-kinase interaction, analogous to a signal transduction system where the cytochrome bf is the receptor and the ligand is the plastoquinol at the Qo site."

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Four-membered ring H-transfers converting 1 to CH3CH2CH=N+HCH3 (2) and CH3N+H=CH2 to CH2=NH+CH3 are high-energy processes involving rotation of the source and destination RHC= groups (R = H or C2H5) to near bisection by skeletal planes; migrating hydrogens move near these planes. The H-transfer 1 --> CH3C+HCH2NHCH3 (3) has a higher energy transition-state than 1 --> 2, in marked contrast to the corresponding relative energies of 4- and 5-membered ring H-transfers in cation-radicals. Six-membered ring H-transfer-dissociation (1 --> CH2=CH2 + CH2=N+HCH3) is a closed shell analog of the McLafferty rearrangement. It has a lower energy transition-state than either 1 --> 2 or 1 --> 3, but is still a much higher energy process than 6-membered ring H-transfers in aliphatic cation radicals. In contrast to the stepwise McLafferty rearrangement in cation radicals, H-transfer and CC bond breaking are highly synchronous in 1 --> CH3N+H=CH2 + CH2=CH2. H-transfers in propene elimination from 1 are ion-neutral complex-mediated: 1--> [CH3CH2CH2+ ---NH=CH2] --> [CH3C+HCH3 NH=CH2] --> CH3CH = CH2 + CH2=NH2+. Intrinsic reaction coordinate tracing demonstrated that a slight preference for H-transfer from the methyl containing the carbon from which CH2=NH is cleaved is due to CH2=NH passing nearer this methyl than the other on its way to abstracting H, i.e., some memory of the initial orientation of the partners accompanies this reaction."

Treatment of exponentially growing MRC5 cells with these cytokines led to a 3-4-fold increase in transferrin receptor mRNA and a coordinate increase in transferrin receptor protein by 24 h. Under these conditions, stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation was minimal, suggesting that the induction of transferrin receptor by TNF and IL-1 is mediated by a growth-independent regulatory mechanism. A study of the time course of this response showed that cytokine-mediated increases in transferrin receptor mRNA and protein proceeded after a lag of 12-24 h. A simultaneous analysis of the effects of TNF and IL-1 on ferritin in MRC5 cells was also performed. Ferritin L mRNA levels were unchanged. However, induction of ferritin H mRNA was seen within 4 h, preceding the induction of the transferrin receptor. The synthesis of ferritin H (but not ferritin L) protein peaked at 8 h after TNF or IL-1 treatment, followed by a rapid decrease in both ferritin H and L protein synthesis. As ferritin H synthesis declined, levels of transferrin receptor protein increased, reaching a maximum by 24 h. These results suggest that the cytokine-dependent induction of ferritin H and subsequent increase in the transferrin receptor are related and possibly interdependent events. This study demonstrates that the complex role of TNF and IL-1 in iron homeostasis includes modulation of the transferrin receptor."

It was also used for molecular dynamics simulations of liquid-phase potentials of mean force as functions of a reaction coordinate.

In this study, mouse strain differences in the adjuvant effect of CTB on anti-HA antibody responses were investigated along with those in the antibody responses to CTB or HA, using various inbred and H-2 congenic strains. The antibody responsiveness to CTB depended on the H-2 haplotype of the strain: strains with the H-2b haplotype were high responders, those with H-2a, H-2k and H-2s were low responders, and those with H-2d were intermediate. The responsiveness to HA was also related to the H-2 haplotype: H-2a and H-2k strains were high responders, H-2b and H-2s strains were low responders, and H-2d strains were intermediate. However, the degree of the adjuvant effect of CTB on anti-HA antibody responses was almost constant, regardless of the H-2 haplotype or other genetic backgrounds of the strain. The lack of genetic restriction of the adjuvant effect would be favourable for application of CTB-combined HA vaccine to humans, who are genetically diverse. Moreover, these results suggest that the immunogenicity and adjuvanticity of CTB differ essentially in their mechanisms."

Although MAC times the olive oil/gas partition coefficient also equals an approximately constant value for normal alkanols from methanol through octanol, the value (0.156 +/- 0.072 atm) is 1/10th that found for conventional anesthetics. We hypothesized that substitution of sulfur for the oxygen in n-alkanols would decrease their saline/gas partition coefficients (i.e., decrease polarity) while sustaining lipid/gas partition coefficients. Further, we hypothesized that these changes would produce products of MAC times olive oil partition coefficients that approximate those of conventional anesthetics. To test these predictions, we measured MAC in rats, and saline and olive oil solubilities for the series H(CH(2))(n)SH, comparing the results with the series H(CH(2))(n)OH for compounds having three to six carbon atoms. As hypothesized, the alkanethiols had similar oil/gas partition coefficients, 1000-fold smaller saline gas partition coefficients, and MAC values 30 times greater than for comparable alkanols.

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Comparison of the results provides interesting insights about the role of highly conserved Arg38 and His42 residues in the chemical features of HRP, underlying its biological activity which initiates with Compound0 (Cpd0). In the WT-HRP enzyme current molecular dynamics simulations show, for the first time, that Arg38 residue: i) prevents the entrance of water inside the reaction cavity, hence providing a hydrophobic reactive scenario, ii) it maintains the distance between His42 and heme-H(2)O(2) complex suitable for the occurrence of proton transfer reaction leading, thereafter, to heme-H(2)O(2) disruption according to Poulos-Kraut mechanism. On the other hand, R38L mutant can be considered as a \"wet enzyme\" where the presence of water solvent molecules in the heme reaction pocket, unfavoring the initial heme-H(2)O(2) complex formation, decreases the catalytic efficiency in agreement with experimental kinetics measurements. Furthermore, we note that Arg38Leu mutation pushes the His42 residue far from the heme-H(2)O(2) complex, making unlikely a direct proton transfer and suggesting that, in the mutant, a solvent water molecule could be involved in the first step of the Poulos-Kraut mechanism."

As a peroxidase, DHP is capable of converting 2,4,6-trihalophenols to the corresponding 2,6-dihaloquinones in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."

Below about 200 K in 75% glycerol/water solvent, ligand rebinding occurs from the heme pocket and is nonexponential in time. The kinetics is explained by a distribution, g(H), of the enthalpic barrier of height H between the pocket and the bound state. Above 170 K rebinding slows markedly. Previously we interpreted the slowing as a \"matrix process\" resulting from the ligand entering the protein matrix before rebinding. Experiments on band III, an inhomogeneously broadened charge-transfer band near 760 nm (approximately 13,000 cm-1) in the photolyzed state (Mb*) of (carbonmonoxy)myoglobin (MbCO), force us to reinterpret the data. Kinetic hole-burning measurements on band III in Mb* establish a relation between the position of a homogeneous component of band III and the barrier H. Since band III is red-shifted by 116 cm-1 in Mb* compared with Mb, the relation implies that the barrier in relaxed Mb is 12 kJ/mol higher than in Mb*. The slowing of the rebinding kinetics above 170 K hence is caused by the relaxation Mb*----Mb, as suggested by Agmon and Hopfield [(1983) J. Chem. Phys. 79, 2042-2053]. This conclusion is supported by a fit to the rebinding data between 160 and 290 K which indicates that the entire distribution g(H) shifts. Above about 200 K, equilibrium fluctuations among conformational substates open pathways for the ligands through the protein matrix and also narrow the rate distribution. The protein relaxations and fluctuations are nonexponential in time and non-Arrhenius in temperature, suggesting a collective nature for these protein motions. The relaxation Mb*----Mb is essentially independent of the solvent viscosity, implying that this motion involves internal parts of the protein. The protein fluctuations responsible for the opening of the pathways, however, depend strongly on the solvent viscosity, suggesting that a large part of the protein participates. While the detailed studies concern MbCO, similar data have been obtained for MbO2 and CO binding to the beta chains of human hemoglobin and hemoglobin Z\u00fcrich. The results show that protein dynamics is essential for protein function and that the association coefficient for binding from the solvent at physiological temperatures in all these heme proteins is governed by the barrier at the heme."

Residues within 5 A of the heme active site were identified. From this group, Leu169 and Ser172 were selected and mutated to Phe and Ala, respectively. The mutant proteins were then characterized by steady-state kinetics. Whereas the Leu169Phe mutation had little, if any, effect on activity, the Ser172Ala mutation decreased kcat and also the specificity constant (kcat/Km) for Mn2+, but not H2O2. Transient-state studies indicated that the mutation affected only the reactions of compound II. These results indicate that compound II is the most sensitive to changes in the heme environment."

We report the 1.95 and 1.35 A resolution crystal structures of the CO- and NO-bound forms of the reduced protein from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. NO disrupts the His-Fe bond and binds in a novel mode to the proximal face of the heme, giving a 5-coordinate species. In contrast, CO binds 6-coordinate on the distal side. A second CO molecule, not bound to the heme, is located in the proximal pocket. Since the unusual spectroscopic properties of cytochromes c' are shared by soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), our findings have potential implications for the activation of sGC induced by the binding of NO or CO to the heme domain."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

The chemically challenging activation and oxidation of non-activated C-H bonds can be achieved with cytochrome P450 enzymes. CYP153AM.aq. -CPRBM3 is an artificial fusion construct consisting of the heme domain from Marinobacter aquaeolei and the reductase domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium. It has the ability to hydroxylate medium- and long-chain fatty acids selectively at their terminal positions. However, the activity of this interesting P450 construct needs to be improved for applications in industrial processes. For this purpose, the design of mutant libraries including two consecutive steps of mutagenesis is demonstrated. Targeted positions and residues chosen for substitution were based on semi-rational protein design after creation of a homology model of the heme domain of CYP153AM.aq. , sequence alignments, and docking studies. Site-directed mutagenesis was the preferred method employed to address positions within the binding pocket, whereas diversity was created with the aid of a degenerate codon for amino acids located at the substrate entrance channel. Combining the successful variants led to the identification of a double variant-G307A/S233G-that showed alterations of one position within the binding pocket and one position located in the substrate access channel. This double variant showed twofold increased activity relative to the wild type for the terminal hydroxylation of medium-chain-length fatty acids. This variant furthermore showed improved activity towards short- and long-chain fatty acids and enhanced stability in the presence of higher concentrations of fatty acids."

In this review, we underline the acute lung pathology (within 24 h of exposure) and potential therapeutic interventions that may be utilized to mitigate Br2 -induced human toxicity. We discuss our latest published data, which suggest that an increase in heme-dependent tissue injury underlies the pathogenesis of Br2 toxicity. Our study was based on previous findings that demonstrated that Br2 upregulates the heme-degrading enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which converts toxic heme into bilverdin. Interestingly, following Br2 inhalation, heme levels were indeed elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and whole lung tissue in C57BL/6 mice. High heme levels correlated with increased lung oxidative stress, lung inflammation, respiratory acidosis, lung edema, higher airway resistance, and mortality. However, therapeutic reduction of heme levels, by either scavenging with hemopexin or degradation by HO-1, improved lung function and survival. Therefore, heme attenuation may prove a useful adjuvant therapy to treat patients after Br2 exposure. "

Peak laminin-induced nitric oxide levels reach 8 nM within 12 s of exposure to laminin and constitutive nitric oxide production is sustained for 1 min. A neurite outgrowth promoting synthetic peptide (AG73), derived from the laminin-1-alpha globular domain, also stimulated nitric oxide release.

In contrast, C16, a synthetic peptide derived from the laminin-1-gamma chain, is shown here to promote PC12 cell attachment, but not neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the C16 peptide did not activate nitric oxide release, suggesting that laminin-induced nitric oxide release in PC12 cells is associated only with neurite outgrowth promoting laminin domains and signals.

Uninephrectomized Wistar rats treated for 7 days with olive oil, cyclosporine (30 mg/kg), nifedipine (3 mg/kg), and nifedipine+cyclosporine were studied. In vehicle and cyclosporine groups, the gene expression of the neuronal, inducible, and endothelial nitric oxide synthases in cerebellum, heart, intestine, liver, renal cortex, and medulla was evaluated. The administration of cyclosporine was associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in renal cortex and liver, and a decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in renal medulla. The mRNA levels of the 3 nitric oxide synthase isoforms were not affected in any other tissue. Nifedipine did not alter nitric oxide synthase expression in the control group but prevented changes associated with cyclosporine.

NOS activity was determined as conversion of L-[(3)H]arginine to L-[(3)H]citrulline in the absence or presence of nicotine (10(-7)-10(-3) M) in vitro. In separate assays, concentrations of cofactors NADPH, FAD, and tetrahydrobioprotein were reduced by half to assess for possible interaction with nicotine. With enzyme from aortic endothelial cells, total and calcium-dependent accumulation of citrulline increased by 30% in the presence of 10(-5) M nicotine. Nicotine dose dependently also increased citrulline accumulation by recombinant eNOS and neuronal NOS but not inducible NOS. Effects of nicotine on accumulation of citrulline by isolated eNOS and recombinant eNOS were further modulated by changes in the concentration of NADPH in the incubation solution. Our data demonstrate a significant effect of nicotine on eNOS-mediated citrulline accumulation. These results suggest that effects of nicotine on production of nitric oxide may depend on NADPH or oxygen radical interactions with NOS and thus may explain, in part, inconsistent findings of changes in production of endothelium-derived nitric oxide with nicotine administration."

Previous studies have reported conflicting results for the roles of nitric oxide in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a major center that regulates sympathetic and cardiovascular activities. We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure. Microinjection of a high dose (100 nmol) of sodium nitroprusside decreased arterial pressure and inhibited spontaneous respiration with concomitant production of peroxynitrite, a strong cytotoxic oxidant. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of L-glutamate were inhibited after preinjection of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol) were inhibited after preinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. They also indicate that nitric oxide may stimulate neurons both through activation of the nitric oxide cyclic GMP pathway and through modulation of glutamate receptor stimulation, and therefore, increase arterial pressure in rats."

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described.

Under anaerobic conditions in the absence of an electron donor, H(2)O(2) could serve as a substrate for MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis. During the reaction with H(2)O(2), a discrete reaction intermediate was observed, which is likely the reduced quinol form of TTQ that then is oxidized to the quinone. These results suggest that not only the incorporation of oxygen into the monohydroxylated biosynthetic intermediate but also the subsequent oxidation of quinol MADH during TTQ biosynthesis is a MauG-dependent process. The implications of these results in elucidating the mechanism of MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis and identifying potential physiologic electron and oxygen donors for TTQ biosynthesis in vivo are discussed."

Characterizations of spectroscopic properties of cytochromes bo and bd isolated from BL21 (DE3)/pLysS and BL21 (DE3)/pLysS/pTTQ18-cyoE after 4 h of the aerobic induction of haem O synthase (CyoE) showed the specific incorporation of haem O into the low-spin haem-binding site in both oxidases. We found that the resultant haem oo- and obd-type oxidase severely reduced the ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity due to the perturbations of the quinol oxidation site. Our observations suggest that haem B is required at the low-spin haem site for the oxidation of quinols by cytochromes bo and bd."

The inventory of epsilonproteobacterial genomes from 21 different species was analysed with respect to key enzymes involved in respiratory nitrogen metabolism. Most ammonifying Epsilonproteobacteria employ two enzymic electron transport systems named Nap (periplasmic nitrate reductase) and Nrf (periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase). The current knowledge on the architecture and function of the corresponding proton motive force-generating respiratory chains using low-potential electron donors are reviewed in this article and the role of membrane-bound quinone/quinol-reactive proteins (NapH and NrfH) that are representative of widespread bacterial electron transport modules is highlighted. Notably, all Epsilonproteobacteria lack a napC gene in their nap gene clusters. Possible roles of the Nap and Nrf systems in anabolism and nitrosative stress defence are also discussed. Free-living denitrifying Epsilonproteobacteria lack the Nrf system but encode cytochrome cd(1) nitrite reductase, at least one nitric oxide reductase and a characteristic cytochrome c nitrous oxide reductase system (cNosZ).

The molecular mechanisms for this process remain unknown, but current views suggest that the plastoquinone pool directly controls the activation of the kinase. On the basis of enzyme activation by a pH shift in the darkness combined with flash photolysis, EPR, and optical spectroscopy we propose that activation occurs when plastoquinol occupies the quinol-oxidation (Qo) site of the cytochrome bf complex, having its high-potential path components in a reduced state. A linear correlation between kinase activation and accessibility of the Qo site to plastoquinol was established by quantification of the shift in the g(y) EPR signal of the Rieske Fe-S center resulting from displacement of the Qo-site plastoquinol by a quinone analog. Activity persists as long as one plastoquinol per cytochrome bf is still available. Withdrawal of one electron from this plastoquinol after a single-turnover flash exciting photosystem I leads to deactivation of the kinase parallel with a decrease in the g(z) EPR signal of the reduced Rieske Fe-S center. Cytochrome f, plastocyanin, and P(700) are rereduced after the flash, indicating that the plastoquinol at the Qo site is limiting in maintaining the kinase activity. These results give direct evidence for a functional cytochrome bf-kinase interaction, analogous to a signal transduction system where the cytochrome bf is the receptor and the ligand is the plastoquinol at the Qo site."

The addition of ilicicolin to the oxidized complex resulted in a non-linear inhibition of the extent of cytochrome b reduction by quinol together with a shift of the reduced b(H) heme spectrum, indicating electron transfer between monomers. The possibility of a fast exchange of ilicicolin between center N sites was excluded in two ways. First, kinetic modeling showed that fast movement of an inhibitor between monomers would result in a linear inhibition of the extent of cytochrome b reduction through center N. Second, we determined a very slow dissociation rate for ilicicolin (k = 1.2 x 10(-3) s(-1)) as calculated from its displacement by antimycin. Ilicicolin binding to the reduced bc(1) complex occurred in a single phase (k(on) = 1.5-1.7 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)) except in the presence of stigmatellin, where a second slower binding phase comprising approximately 50% of the spectral change was observed. This second kinetic event was weakly dependent on ilicicolin concentration, which suggests that binding of ilicicolin to one center N in the dimer transmits a slow (k = 2-3 s(-1)) conformational change that allows binding of the inhibitor in the other monomer. These results, together with the evidence for intermonomeric electron transfer, provide further support for a dimeric model of regulatory interactions between center P and center N sites in the bc(1) complex."

An unusual Fe-S center, named X, associated with a signal at g = 2.057, was also detected, which was reduced by dithionite but not by NADH or NADPH. Extremely fast spin-relaxation rates of flavin- and quinone-free radicals suggest their close proximity to the [4Fe-4S] cluster or the high-spin [1Fe]3+ center. Envelope membranes probably contain enzymatic activities involved in the formation and reduction of semiquinone radicals (quinol oxidase, NADPH-quinone, and NADPH-semiquinone reductases).

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described.

Antibodies against CYPOR inhibited NO consumption by brain membranes and the amount of CYPOR in several cell types correlated with their rate of NO consumption. NO was also consumed by purified CYPOR but this activity was found to depend on the presence of the vitamin E analogue Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid), included in the buffer as a precaution against inadvertent NO consumption by lipid peroxidation. In contrast, NO consumption by brain membranes was independent of Trolox. Hence, it appears that, during the purification process, CYPOR becomes separated from a partner needed for NO consumption. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors inhibited NO consumption by brain membranes, making these proteins likely candidates."

Based on reports that exposure to oxidant gases results in pulmonary extracellular matrix injury associated with elevated lavage fluid levels of extracellular matrix components, we hypothesized that inhaled NO with or without hyperoxia will have the same effect. We measured alveolar septal width, lung collagen content, lavage fluid hydroxyproline, hyaluronan and laminin levels in neonatal piglets after 5 days' exposure to room air (RA), RA + 50 ppm NO (RA + NO), O(2) (FiO(2) > 0.96) or O(2) + NO. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and MMP-2 mRNA were also measured. In recovery experiments, we measured lung collagen content in piglets exposed to RA + NO or O(2) + NO and then allowed to recover for 3 days. The results show that lung collagen increased 4-fold in the RA + NO piglets, the O(2) and O(2) + NO groups had only a 2-fold elevation relative to RA controls. Unlike the RA + NO piglets, the O(2) and O(2) + NO groups had more than 20-fold elevation in lung lavage fluid hydroxyproline compared to the RA group. O(2) and O(2) + NO also had increased lung MMP activity, extravascular water, and lavage fluid proteins. MMP-2 mRNA levels were unchanged. After 3 days' recovery in room air, the RA + NO groups' lung collagen had declined from 4-fold to 2-fold above the RA group values. The O(2) + NO group did not decline. Alveolar septal width increased significantly only in the O(2) and O(2) + NO groups. We conclude that 5 days' exposure to NO does not result in pulmonary matrix degradation but instead significantly increases lung collagen content. This effect appears potentially reversible. In contrast, hyperoxia exposure with or without NO results in pulmonary matrix degradation and increased lung collagen content. The observation that NO increased lung collagen content represents a new finding and suggests NO could potentially induce pulmonary fibrosis."

A high-speed video camera allowed observation of cavitation and gas bubble release on the inflow valve surfaces as a function of cavitation intensity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, while an ultrasonic monitoring system scanned the aortic outflow tract to quantify gas bubble production by calculating the gray scale levels of the images. In the absence of cavitation, no stable gas bubbles were formed. When gas bubbles were formed, they were first seen a few milliseconds after and in the vicinity of cavitation collapse. The volume of the gas bubbles detected in the aortic track increased with both increased CO2 and increased cavitation intensity. No correlation was observed between O2 concentration and bubble volume. We conclude that cavitation is an essential precursor to stable gas bubble formation, and CO2, the most soluble blood gas, is the major component of stable gas bubbles."

We found that 1) room temperature dry gas hyperpnea increased Evans blue extravasation in extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary airways as a specific consequence of local airway heat/water losses, 2) capsaicin pretreatment ablated the bronchoconstrictor response to dry gas hyperpnea and reduced bronchovascular leak only in intrapulmonary airways, 3) phosphoramidon given to capsaicin-pretreated animals partially restored dry gas hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction and increased the vascular hyperpermeability response to hyperpnea in intrapulmonary airways, and 4) propranolol administration had no important effects on any of these airway responses. We conclude that dry gas hyperpnea causes bronchovascular hyperpermeability in guinea pigs.

Gas fermentation has matured to the point that large-scale production of ethanol from gas has been demonstrated by two companies. This review gives an overview of the gas fermentation process, focusing specifically on anaerobic acetogens. Applications of synthetic biology and coupling gas fermentation to additional processes are discussed in detail. Both of these strategies, demonstrated at bench-scale, have abundant potential to rapidly expand the commercial product spectrum of gas fermentation and further improve efficiencies and yields. "

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

As a peroxidase, DHP is capable of converting 2,4,6-trihalophenols to the corresponding 2,6-dihaloquinones in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

We mutated a target residue in that site (Ser-1412 to Asp) to mimic phosphorylation and then characterized the mutant using conventional and stopped-flow spectroscopies. Compared with wild-type, S1412D nNOS catalyzed faster cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction but displayed slower steady-state NO synthesis with greater uncoupling of NADPH oxidation. Paradoxically, the mutant had faster heme reduction, faster heme-NO complex formation, and greater heme-NO complex accumulation at steady state. To understand how these behaviors related to flavin and heme reduction rates, we utilized three soybean calmodulins (CaMs) that supported a range of slower flavin and heme reduction rates in mutant and wild-type nNOS. Reductase activity and two catalytic parameters (speed and amount of heme-NO complex formation) related directly to the speed of flavin and heme reduction. In contrast, steady-state NO synthesis increased, reached a plateau, and then fell at the highest rate of heme reduction that was obtained with S1412D nNOS + CaM. Substituting with soybean CaM slowed heme reduction and increased steady-state NO synthesis by the mutant. We conclude the following. 1) The S1412D mutation speeds electron transfer out of the reductase domain. 2) Faster heme reduction speeds intrinsic NO synthesis but diminishes NO release in the steady state. 3) Heme reduction displays an optimum regarding NO release during steady state. The unique behavior of S1412D nNOS reveals the importance of heme reduction rate in controlling steady-state activity and suggests that nNOS already has a near-optimal rate of heme reduction."

Comparison of the results provides interesting insights about the role of highly conserved Arg38 and His42 residues in the chemical features of HRP, underlying its biological activity which initiates with Compound0 (Cpd0). In the WT-HRP enzyme current molecular dynamics simulations show, for the first time, that Arg38 residue: i) prevents the entrance of water inside the reaction cavity, hence providing a hydrophobic reactive scenario, ii) it maintains the distance between His42 and heme-H(2)O(2) complex suitable for the occurrence of proton transfer reaction leading, thereafter, to heme-H(2)O(2) disruption according to Poulos-Kraut mechanism. On the other hand, R38L mutant can be considered as a \"wet enzyme\" where the presence of water solvent molecules in the heme reaction pocket, unfavoring the initial heme-H(2)O(2) complex formation, decreases the catalytic efficiency in agreement with experimental kinetics measurements. Furthermore, we note that Arg38Leu mutation pushes the His42 residue far from the heme-H(2)O(2) complex, making unlikely a direct proton transfer and suggesting that, in the mutant, a solvent water molecule could be involved in the first step of the Poulos-Kraut mechanism."

To understand this process, we developed a 10-step kinetic model in which the ferric heme-NO enzyme forms as the immediate product of catalysis, and then partitions between NO dissociation versus reduction to a ferrous heme-NO complex. Rate constants used for the model were derived from recent literature or were determined here. Computer simulations of the model precisely described both pre-steady and steady-state features of nNOS catalysis, including NADPH consumption and NO production, buildup of a heme-NO complex, changes between pre-steady and steady-state rates, and the change in enzyme K(m,O(2)) in the presence or absence of NO synthesis. The model also correctly simulated the catalytic features of nNOS mutants W409F and W409Y, which are hyperactive and display less heme-NO complex formation in the steady state. Model simulations showed how the rate of heme reduction influences several features of nNOS catalysis, including populations of NO-bound versus NO-free enzyme in the steady state and the rate of NO synthesis. The simulation predicts that there is an optimum rate of heme reduction that is close to the measured rate in nNOS. Ratio between NADPH consumption and NO synthesis is also predicted to increase with faster heme reduction. Our kinetic model is an accurate and versatile tool for understanding catalytic behavior and will provide new perspectives on NOS regulation."

Below about 200 K in 75% glycerol/water solvent, ligand rebinding occurs from the heme pocket and is nonexponential in time. The kinetics is explained by a distribution, g(H), of the enthalpic barrier of height H between the pocket and the bound state. Above 170 K rebinding slows markedly. Previously we interpreted the slowing as a \"matrix process\" resulting from the ligand entering the protein matrix before rebinding. Experiments on band III, an inhomogeneously broadened charge-transfer band near 760 nm (approximately 13,000 cm-1) in the photolyzed state (Mb*) of (carbonmonoxy)myoglobin (MbCO), force us to reinterpret the data. Kinetic hole-burning measurements on band III in Mb* establish a relation between the position of a homogeneous component of band III and the barrier H. Since band III is red-shifted by 116 cm-1 in Mb* compared with Mb, the relation implies that the barrier in relaxed Mb is 12 kJ/mol higher than in Mb*. The slowing of the rebinding kinetics above 170 K hence is caused by the relaxation Mb*----Mb, as suggested by Agmon and Hopfield [(1983) J. Chem. Phys. 79, 2042-2053]. This conclusion is supported by a fit to the rebinding data between 160 and 290 K which indicates that the entire distribution g(H) shifts. Above about 200 K, equilibrium fluctuations among conformational substates open pathways for the ligands through the protein matrix and also narrow the rate distribution. The protein relaxations and fluctuations are nonexponential in time and non-Arrhenius in temperature, suggesting a collective nature for these protein motions. The relaxation Mb*----Mb is essentially independent of the solvent viscosity, implying that this motion involves internal parts of the protein. The protein fluctuations responsible for the opening of the pathways, however, depend strongly on the solvent viscosity, suggesting that a large part of the protein participates. While the detailed studies concern MbCO, similar data have been obtained for MbO2 and CO binding to the beta chains of human hemoglobin and hemoglobin Z\u00fcrich. The results show that protein dynamics is essential for protein function and that the association coefficient for binding from the solvent at physiological temperatures in all these heme proteins is governed by the barrier at the heme."

Mass analyses of wild-type human Mb treated aerobically with NO indicated a mass increase of approximately 30 atomic mass units (i.e., NO/Mb = 1 mol/mol).

It can occur as a primary condition or secondary to a variety of other diseases. Endogenous nitric oxide is an important modulator of vascular tone in pulmonary circulation. Initial uncontrolled studies indicated that inhalation of nitric oxide resulted in a reduction in pulmonary hypertension, with improvement in oxygenation, but no change in the systemic vascular resistance. There have now been a number of randomised trials performed exploring the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide. These trials have demonstrated that in at term or near term infants, inhaled nitric oxide reduces the combined end point of death or the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The significant effect seems due to the reduced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation requirement. No such beneficial effect has been consistently reported in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Randomised trials have failed to highlight long-term positive results in preterm infants. Inhaled nitric oxide has side effects, although those due to nitrogen dioxide and methaemoglobin formation can be minimised by appropriate nitric oxide delivery. It is important to use the smallest effective nitric oxide dose, continuous nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide monitoring and frequent methaemoglobin analyses. Careful patient selection should be undertaken, avoiding those at high risk of haemorrhagic complications. Longer term follow-up studies are required to determine the real risk:benefit ratio of inhaled nitric oxide treatment."

Measurements included macroscopic and microscopic damage, superoxide anion generation, mucosal nitric oxide synthase activity, and peroxynitrite formation. Low-grade esophagitis was associated with increased nitric oxide synthase mucosal activity and mucosal damage was dose-dependently increased by treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine. Superoxide anion was scarcely generated in the mucosa, but this was not accompanied by any change in the activity of mucosal superoxide dismutase. Treatment with superoxide dismutase did not improve mucosal damage. Generation of peroxynitrites was not detected.

Peak laminin-induced nitric oxide levels reach 8 nM within 12 s of exposure to laminin and constitutive nitric oxide production is sustained for 1 min.

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family."

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex.

From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

After 8 weeks of treatment, the eNOS, iNOS, and caveolin-1 protein expressions in the aorta and kidney were analyzed by western blotting. The SBP of the ABE-treated SHR was significantly lower than that of the untreated SHR. The level of 24-h urinary NOx excretion was significantly higher in the ABE-treated SHR than in the untreated SHR. The eNOS and iNOS expressions in the aorta and kidney were remarkably upregulated in the untreated SHR but suppressed in the ABE-treated SHR.

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family."

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria.

Increased production of oil and natural gas, particularly from shale resources using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, made the United States the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas in 2014. This review examines air quality impacts, specifically, changes in greenhouse gas, criteria air pollutant, and air toxics emissions from oil and gas production activities that are a result of these changes in energy supplies and use. National emission inventories indicate that volatile organic compound (VOC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from oil and gas supply chains in the United States have been increasing significantly, whereas emission inventories for greenhouse gases have seen slight declines over the past decade. These emission inventories are based on counts of equipment and operational activities (activity factors), multiplied by average emission factors, and therefore are subject to uncertainties in these factors. Although uncertainties associated with activity data and missing emission source types can be significant, multiple recent measurement studies indicate that the greatest uncertainties are associated with emission factors. In many source categories, small groups of devices or sites, referred to as super-emitters, contribute a large fraction of emissions. When super-emitters are accounted for, multiple measurement approaches, at multiple scales, produce similar results for estimated emissions. Challenges moving forward include identifying super-emitters and reducing their emission magnitudes. Work done to date suggests that both equipment malfunction and operational practices can be important. Finally, although most of this review focuses on emissions from energy supply infrastructures, the regional air quality implications of some coupled energy production and use scenarios are examined. These case studies suggest that both energy production and use should be considered in assessing air quality implications of changes in energy infrastructures, and that impacts are likely to vary among regions."

As a peroxidase, DHP is capable of converting 2,4,6-trihalophenols to the corresponding 2,6-dihaloquinones in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

Comparison of the results provides interesting insights about the role of highly conserved Arg38 and His42 residues in the chemical features of HRP, underlying its biological activity which initiates with Compound0 (Cpd0). In the WT-HRP enzyme current molecular dynamics simulations show, for the first time, that Arg38 residue: i) prevents the entrance of water inside the reaction cavity, hence providing a hydrophobic reactive scenario, ii) it maintains the distance between His42 and heme-H(2)O(2) complex suitable for the occurrence of proton transfer reaction leading, thereafter, to heme-H(2)O(2) disruption according to Poulos-Kraut mechanism. On the other hand, R38L mutant can be considered as a \"wet enzyme\" where the presence of water solvent molecules in the heme reaction pocket, unfavoring the initial heme-H(2)O(2) complex formation, decreases the catalytic efficiency in agreement with experimental kinetics measurements. Furthermore, we note that Arg38Leu mutation pushes the His42 residue far from the heme-H(2)O(2) complex, making unlikely a direct proton transfer and suggesting that, in the mutant, a solvent water molecule could be involved in the first step of the Poulos-Kraut mechanism."

Below about 200 K in 75% glycerol/water solvent, ligand rebinding occurs from the heme pocket and is nonexponential in time. The kinetics is explained by a distribution, g(H), of the enthalpic barrier of height H between the pocket and the bound state. Above 170 K rebinding slows markedly. Previously we interpreted the slowing as a \"matrix process\" resulting from the ligand entering the protein matrix before rebinding. Experiments on band III, an inhomogeneously broadened charge-transfer band near 760 nm (approximately 13,000 cm-1) in the photolyzed state (Mb*) of (carbonmonoxy)myoglobin (MbCO), force us to reinterpret the data. Kinetic hole-burning measurements on band III in Mb* establish a relation between the position of a homogeneous component of band III and the barrier H. Since band III is red-shifted by 116 cm-1 in Mb* compared with Mb, the relation implies that the barrier in relaxed Mb is 12 kJ/mol higher than in Mb*. The slowing of the rebinding kinetics above 170 K hence is caused by the relaxation Mb*----Mb, as suggested by Agmon and Hopfield [(1983) J. Chem. Phys. 79, 2042-2053]. This conclusion is supported by a fit to the rebinding data between 160 and 290 K which indicates that the entire distribution g(H) shifts. Above about 200 K, equilibrium fluctuations among conformational substates open pathways for the ligands through the protein matrix and also narrow the rate distribution. The protein relaxations and fluctuations are nonexponential in time and non-Arrhenius in temperature, suggesting a collective nature for these protein motions. The relaxation Mb*----Mb is essentially independent of the solvent viscosity, implying that this motion involves internal parts of the protein. The protein fluctuations responsible for the opening of the pathways, however, depend strongly on the solvent viscosity, suggesting that a large part of the protein participates. While the detailed studies concern MbCO, similar data have been obtained for MbO2 and CO binding to the beta chains of human hemoglobin and hemoglobin Z\u00fcrich. The results show that protein dynamics is essential for protein function and that the association coefficient for binding from the solvent at physiological temperatures in all these heme proteins is governed by the barrier at the heme."

It has the ability to hydroxylate medium- and long-chain fatty acids selectively at their terminal positions. However, the activity of this interesting P450 construct needs to be improved for applications in industrial processes. For this purpose, the design of mutant libraries including two consecutive steps of mutagenesis is demonstrated. Targeted positions and residues chosen for substitution were based on semi-rational protein design after creation of a homology model of the heme domain of CYP153AM.aq. , sequence alignments, and docking studies. Site-directed mutagenesis was the preferred method employed to address positions within the binding pocket, whereas diversity was created with the aid of a degenerate codon for amino acids located at the substrate entrance channel. Combining the successful variants led to the identification of a double variant-G307A/S233G-that showed alterations of one position within the binding pocket and one position located in the substrate access channel. This double variant showed twofold increased activity relative to the wild type for the terminal hydroxylation of medium-chain-length fatty acids.

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

Peak laminin-induced nitric oxide levels reach 8 nM within 12 s of exposure to laminin and constitutive nitric oxide production is sustained for 1 min.

In contrast, C16, a synthetic peptide derived from the laminin-1-gamma chain, is shown here to promote PC12 cell attachment, but not neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the C16 peptide did not activate nitric oxide release, suggesting that laminin-induced nitric oxide release in PC12 cells is associated only with neurite outgrowth promoting laminin domains and signals.

We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure. Microinjection of a high dose (100 nmol) of sodium nitroprusside decreased arterial pressure and inhibited spontaneous respiration with concomitant production of peroxynitrite, a strong cytotoxic oxidant. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of L-glutamate were inhibited after preinjection of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol) were inhibited after preinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm.

MauG is a novel 42 kDa di-heme protein, which is required for the biosynthesis of TTQ. An experimental system has been developed that allows the direct continuous monitoring of MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis in vitro. Four diverse electron donors, ascorbate, dithiothreitol, reduced glutathione, and NADH, were each able to provide reducing equivalents for MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis under aerobic conditions. The reaction with NADH was mediated by an NADH-dependent oxidoreductase. Under anaerobic conditions in the absence of an electron donor, H(2)O(2) could serve as a substrate for MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis.

Three central classes of findings have to be accounted for: (a) Recognition performance varies systematically with orientation, size, and position; (b) recognition latencies are sequentially additive, suggesting analogue transformation processes; and (c) orientation and size congruency effects indicate that recognition involves the adjustment of a reference frame. All 3 classes of findings can be explained by a transformational framework of recognition: Recognition is achieved by an analogue transformation of a perceptual coordinate system that aligns memory and input representations. Coordinate transformations can be implemented neurocomputationally by gain (amplitude) modulation and may be regarded as a general processing principle of the visual cortex."

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family."

The molecular mechanisms for this process remain unknown, but current views suggest that the plastoquinone pool directly controls the activation of the kinase. On the basis of enzyme activation by a pH shift in the darkness combined with flash photolysis, EPR, and optical spectroscopy we propose that activation occurs when plastoquinol occupies the quinol-oxidation (Qo) site of the cytochrome bf complex, having its high-potential path components in a reduced state. A linear correlation between kinase activation and accessibility of the Qo site to plastoquinol was established by quantification of the shift in the g(y) EPR signal of the Rieske Fe-S center resulting from displacement of the Qo-site plastoquinol by a quinone analog. Activity persists as long as one plastoquinol per cytochrome bf is still available. Withdrawal of one electron from this plastoquinol after a single-turnover flash exciting photosystem I leads to deactivation of the kinase parallel with a decrease in the g(z) EPR signal of the reduced Rieske Fe-S center. Cytochrome f, plastocyanin, and P(700) are rereduced after the flash, indicating that the plastoquinol at the Qo site is limiting in maintaining the kinase activity.

The addition of ilicicolin to the oxidized complex resulted in a non-linear inhibition of the extent of cytochrome b reduction by quinol together with a shift of the reduced b(H) heme spectrum, indicating electron transfer between monomers. The possibility of a fast exchange of ilicicolin between center N sites was excluded in two ways. First, kinetic modeling showed that fast movement of an inhibitor between monomers would result in a linear inhibition of the extent of cytochrome b reduction through center N. Second, we determined a very slow dissociation rate for ilicicolin (k = 1.2 x 10(-3) s(-1)) as calculated from its displacement by antimycin. Ilicicolin binding to the reduced bc(1) complex occurred in a single phase (k(on) = 1.5-1.7 x 10(5) m(-1) s(-1)) except in the presence of stigmatellin, where a second slower binding phase comprising approximately 50% of the spectral change was observed. This second kinetic event was weakly dependent on ilicicolin concentration, which suggests that binding of ilicicolin to one center N in the dimer transmits a slow (k = 2-3 s(-1)) conformational change that allows binding of the inhibitor in the other monomer. These results, together with the evidence for intermonomeric electron transfer, provide further support for a dimeric model of regulatory interactions between center P and center N sites in the bc(1) complex."

In sharp comparison, the synthesis of trifluoromethylated arenes based on the pre-introduction of a trifluoromethyl group onto an \"aromatic to be\" carbon has rarely been addressed. It has been found that 4-trifluoromethyl-p-quinol silyl ethers, the readily available and relatively stable compounds, can act as dielectrophiles to be applied to multi-component reactions for the synthesis of various trifluoromethylated arenes. Catalyzed by In(OTf)3, 4-trifluoromethyl-p-quinol silyl ethers react with C-, N-, and S-nucleophiles, respectively, in a regiospecific 1,2-addition manner to generate the corresponding highly reactive electrophilic intermediates. Further reaction of the in-situ generated electrophiles with a C-nucleophile followed by spontaneous aromatization enables the construction of functionalized trifluoromethyl arenes. This three-component, double nucleophilic addition/aromatization reaction based on the pre-introduction of a trifluoromethyl group onto an \"aromatic to be\" carbon provides a divergent strategy for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated arenes under mild reaction conditions in a single operation.

MauG is a novel 42 kDa di-heme protein, which is required for the biosynthesis of TTQ. An experimental system has been developed that allows the direct continuous monitoring of MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis in vitro. Four diverse electron donors, ascorbate, dithiothreitol, reduced glutathione, and NADH, were each able to provide reducing equivalents for MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis under aerobic conditions. The reaction with NADH was mediated by an NADH-dependent oxidoreductase. Under anaerobic conditions in the absence of an electron donor, H(2)O(2) could serve as a substrate for MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis. During the reaction with H(2)O(2), a discrete reaction intermediate was observed, which is likely the reduced quinol form of TTQ that then is oxidized to the quinone. These results suggest that not only the incorporation of oxygen into the monohydroxylated biosynthetic intermediate but also the subsequent oxidation of quinol MADH during TTQ biosynthesis is a MauG-dependent process. The implications of these results in elucidating the mechanism of MauG-dependent TTQ biosynthesis and identifying potential physiologic electron and oxygen donors for TTQ biosynthesis in vivo are discussed."

A high-speed video camera allowed observation of cavitation and gas bubble release on the inflow valve surfaces as a function of cavitation intensity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, while an ultrasonic monitoring system scanned the aortic outflow tract to quantify gas bubble production by calculating the gray scale levels of the images.

The volume of the gas bubbles detected in the aortic track increased with both increased CO2 and increased cavitation intensity.

As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130.

Comparison of the results provides interesting insights about the role of highly conserved Arg38 and His42 residues in the chemical features of HRP, underlying its biological activity which initiates with Compound0 (Cpd0). In the WT-HRP enzyme current molecular dynamics simulations show, for the first time, that Arg38 residue: i) prevents the entrance of water inside the reaction cavity, hence providing a hydrophobic reactive scenario, ii) it maintains the distance between His42 and heme-H(2)O(2) complex suitable for the occurrence of proton transfer reaction leading, thereafter, to heme-H(2)O(2) disruption according to Poulos-Kraut mechanism. On the other hand, R38L mutant can be considered as a \"wet enzyme\" where the presence of water solvent molecules in the heme reaction pocket, unfavoring the initial heme-H(2)O(2) complex formation, decreases the catalytic efficiency in agreement with experimental kinetics measurements. Furthermore, we note that Arg38Leu mutation pushes the His42 residue far from the heme-H(2)O(2) complex, making unlikely a direct proton transfer and suggesting that, in the mutant, a solvent water molecule could be involved in the first step of the Poulos-Kraut mechanism."

Below about 200 K in 75% glycerol/water solvent, ligand rebinding occurs from the heme pocket and is nonexponential in time. The kinetics is explained by a distribution, g(H), of the enthalpic barrier of height H between the pocket and the bound state. Above 170 K rebinding slows markedly. Previously we interpreted the slowing as a \"matrix process\" resulting from the ligand entering the protein matrix before rebinding. Experiments on band III, an inhomogeneously broadened charge-transfer band near 760 nm (approximately 13,000 cm-1) in the photolyzed state (Mb*) of (carbonmonoxy)myoglobin (MbCO), force us to reinterpret the data. Kinetic hole-burning measurements on band III in Mb* establish a relation between the position of a homogeneous component of band III and the barrier H. Since band III is red-shifted by 116 cm-1 in Mb* compared with Mb, the relation implies that the barrier in relaxed Mb is 12 kJ/mol higher than in Mb*. The slowing of the rebinding kinetics above 170 K hence is caused by the relaxation Mb*----Mb, as suggested by Agmon and Hopfield [(1983) J. Chem. Phys. 79, 2042-2053]. This conclusion is supported by a fit to the rebinding data between 160 and 290 K which indicates that the entire distribution g(H) shifts. Above about 200 K, equilibrium fluctuations among conformational substates open pathways for the ligands through the protein matrix and also narrow the rate distribution. The protein relaxations and fluctuations are nonexponential in time and non-Arrhenius in temperature, suggesting a collective nature for these protein motions. The relaxation Mb*----Mb is essentially independent of the solvent viscosity, implying that this motion involves internal parts of the protein. The protein fluctuations responsible for the opening of the pathways, however, depend strongly on the solvent viscosity, suggesting that a large part of the protein participates. While the detailed studies concern MbCO, similar data have been obtained for MbO2 and CO binding to the beta chains of human hemoglobin and hemoglobin Z\u00fcrich. The results show that protein dynamics is essential for protein function and that the association coefficient for binding from the solvent at physiological temperatures in all these heme proteins is governed by the barrier at the heme."

We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure. Microinjection of a high dose (100 nmol) of sodium nitroprusside decreased arterial pressure and inhibited spontaneous respiration with concomitant production of peroxynitrite, a strong cytotoxic oxidant. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of L-glutamate were inhibited after preinjection of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol) were inhibited after preinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla.

Initial uncontrolled studies indicated that inhalation of nitric oxide resulted in a reduction in pulmonary hypertension, with improvement in oxygenation, but no change in the systemic vascular resistance. There have now been a number of randomised trials performed exploring the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide. These trials have demonstrated that in at term or near term infants, inhaled nitric oxide reduces the combined end point of death or the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The significant effect seems due to the reduced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation requirement. No such beneficial effect has been consistently reported in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Randomised trials have failed to highlight long-term positive results in preterm infants. Inhaled nitric oxide has side effects, although those due to nitrogen dioxide and methaemoglobin formation can be minimised by appropriate nitric oxide delivery. It is important to use the smallest effective nitric oxide dose, continuous nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide monitoring and frequent methaemoglobin analyses. Careful patient selection should be undertaken, avoiding those at high risk of haemorrhagic complications. Longer term follow-up studies are required to determine the real risk:benefit ratio of inhaled nitric oxide treatment."

Protein acetyltransferase action of Calreticulin was hence termed Calreticulin transacetylase (CRTAase). Nitric oxide synthase and nitrite reductase are now considered as parts of nitric oxide cycle. The activation of platelets nitric oxide synthase by 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin has already been demonstrated by us. Also, there are reports that certain proteins such as cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochrome P-450 are endowed with the nitrite reductase activity in mammalian cells. Keeping these facts in view, we turned our attention to probe whether 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin could alter the levels of nitric oxide independent of the action of nitric oxide synthase in the human platelets model. The incubation of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin and nitrite with platelets caused significant elevation of nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels possibly due to the activation of nitrite reductase. Several polyphenolic acetates were similarly found to activate the nitrite reductase in tune with their affinities as substrate to CRTAase. N-omega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, failed to reverse such an effect of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin. Clotrimazole which is known to be an inhibitor of nitrite reductase, effectively abolished the 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin mediated enhancement of nitric oxide levels in platelets as well as the nitric oxide mediated effects; such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels as well as adenosine diphospate induced platelets aggregation due to nitrite."

The electrical and optical properties of zinc oxide film vary in the presence of nitric oxide. This effect was utilized to prepare biochemical sensors with transduction based on surface plasmon resonance. Due to the refractive index of the transparent zinc oxide film that was deposited on the gold film, however, changes will be observed in the surface plasmon resonance spectra. For this reason, the thickness of zinc oxide film will be investigated and determined in this study. The interaction of nitric oxide with a 20 nm zinc oxide layer on gold leads to the shift of the resonance angle. The analysis on the reflectance intensity of light demonstrates that such effect is caused by the variation of conductivity and permittivity of zinc oxide film. Finally, a shift in surface plasmon resonance angle was measured in 25 ppm nitric oxide at 180 C and a calibration curve of nitride oxide concentration versus response intensity was successfully obtained in the range of 250 to 1000 ppm nitric oxide at lower temperature of 150 C. Moreover, these effects are quasi-reversible."

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family."

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

As a peroxidase, DHP is capable of converting 2,4,6-trihalophenols to the corresponding 2,6-dihaloquinones in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria.

As a peroxidase, DHP is capable of converting 2,4,6-trihalophenols to the corresponding 2,6-dihaloquinones in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."

Although there are several examples of amino acid sidechains with oxygen atoms which can act as potential heme iron ligands, the occurrence of protein-derived oxygen donor ligation in natural protein systems is quite rare. The sperm whale myoglobin cavity mutant H93G Mb (D. Barrick, Biochemistry 33 (1994) 6546) has its proximal histidine ligand replaced by glycine, a mutation which leaves an open cavity capable of accommodation of a variety of unnatural potential proximal ligands. This provides a convenient system for studying ligand-protein interactions. Molecular modeling of the proximal cavity in the active site of H93G Mb indicates that the cavity is of sufficient size to accommodate benzoate and phenolate in conformations that allow their oxygen atoms to come within binding distance of the heme iron. In addition, benzoate may occupy the cavity in an orientation which allows one carboxylate oxygen atom to ligate to the heme iron while the other carboxylate oxygen is within hydrogen bonding distance of serine 92. The ferric phenolate and benzoate complexes have been prepared and characterized by UV-visible and MCD spectroscopies. The benzoate adduct shows characteristics of a six-coordinate high-spin complex. To our knowledge, this is the first known example of a six-coordinate high-spin heme complex with an anionic oxygen donor proximal ligand. The benzoate ligand is displaced at alkaline pH and upon reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The phenolate adduct of H93G Mb is a five-coordinate high-spin complex whose UV-visible and MCD spectra are distinct from those of the histidine 93 to tyrosine (H93Y Mb) mutant of sperm whale myoglobin. The phenolate adduct is stable at alkaline pH and exhibits a reduced reactivity with hydrogen peroxide relative to that of both native ferric myoglobin, and the exogenous ligand-free derivative of ferric H93G Mb. These observations indicate that the identity of the proximal oxygen donor ligand has an important influence on both the heme iron coordination number and the reactivity of the complex with hydrogen peroxide."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

Comparison of the results provides interesting insights about the role of highly conserved Arg38 and His42 residues in the chemical features of HRP, underlying its biological activity which initiates with Compound0 (Cpd0). In the WT-HRP enzyme current molecular dynamics simulations show, for the first time, that Arg38 residue: i) prevents the entrance of water inside the reaction cavity, hence providing a hydrophobic reactive scenario, ii) it maintains the distance between His42 and heme-H(2)O(2) complex suitable for the occurrence of proton transfer reaction leading, thereafter, to heme-H(2)O(2) disruption according to Poulos-Kraut mechanism. On the other hand, R38L mutant can be considered as a \"wet enzyme\" where the presence of water solvent molecules in the heme reaction pocket, unfavoring the initial heme-H(2)O(2) complex formation, decreases the catalytic efficiency in agreement with experimental kinetics measurements. Furthermore, we note that Arg38Leu mutation pushes the His42 residue far from the heme-H(2)O(2) complex, making unlikely a direct proton transfer and suggesting that, in the mutant, a solvent water molecule could be involved in the first step of the Poulos-Kraut mechanism."

While a single barrier is observed for the cage recombination of NO with heme in the absence of globin, recombination in hemoglobin and myoglobin is nonexponential. Examination of hemoglobin with and without inositol hexaphosphate points to proximal constraints as important determinants of the geminate rebinding kinetics. Molecular dynamics simulations of myoglobin and heme-imidazole subsequent to ligand dissociation were used to investigate the transient behavior of the Fe-proximal histidine coordinate and its possible involvement in geminate recombination. The calculations, in the context of the absorption measurements, are used to formulate a distinction between nonexponential rebinding that results from multiple protein conformations (substates) present at equilibrium or from nonequilibrium relaxation of the protein triggered by a perturbation such as ligand dissociation. The importance of these two processes is expected to depend on the time scale of rebinding relative to equilibrium fluctuations and nonequilibrium relaxation. Since NO rebinding occurs on the picosecond time scale of the calculated myoglobin relaxation, a time-dependent barrier is likely to be an important factor in the observed nonexponential kinetics. The general implications of the present results for ligand binding in heme proteins and its time and temperature dependence are discussed. It appears likely that, at low temperatures, inhomogeneous protein populations play an important role and that as the temperature is raised, relaxation effects become significant as well."

Below about 200 K in 75% glycerol/water solvent, ligand rebinding occurs from the heme pocket and is nonexponential in time. The kinetics is explained by a distribution, g(H), of the enthalpic barrier of height H between the pocket and the bound state. Above 170 K rebinding slows markedly. Previously we interpreted the slowing as a \"matrix process\" resulting from the ligand entering the protein matrix before rebinding. Experiments on band III, an inhomogeneously broadened charge-transfer band near 760 nm (approximately 13,000 cm-1) in the photolyzed state (Mb*) of (carbonmonoxy)myoglobin (MbCO), force us to reinterpret the data. Kinetic hole-burning measurements on band III in Mb* establish a relation between the position of a homogeneous component of band III and the barrier H. Since band III is red-shifted by 116 cm-1 in Mb* compared with Mb, the relation implies that the barrier in relaxed Mb is 12 kJ/mol higher than in Mb*. The slowing of the rebinding kinetics above 170 K hence is caused by the relaxation Mb*----Mb, as suggested by Agmon and Hopfield [(1983) J. Chem. Phys. 79, 2042-2053]. This conclusion is supported by a fit to the rebinding data between 160 and 290 K which indicates that the entire distribution g(H) shifts. Above about 200 K, equilibrium fluctuations among conformational substates open pathways for the ligands through the protein matrix and also narrow the rate distribution. The protein relaxations and fluctuations are nonexponential in time and non-Arrhenius in temperature, suggesting a collective nature for these protein motions. The relaxation Mb*----Mb is essentially independent of the solvent viscosity, implying that this motion involves internal parts of the protein. The protein fluctuations responsible for the opening of the pathways, however, depend strongly on the solvent viscosity, suggesting that a large part of the protein participates. While the detailed studies concern MbCO, similar data have been obtained for MbO2 and CO binding to the beta chains of human hemoglobin and hemoglobin Z\u00fcrich. The results show that protein dynamics is essential for protein function and that the association coefficient for binding from the solvent at physiological temperatures in all these heme proteins is governed by the barrier at the heme."

Peak laminin-induced nitric oxide levels reach 8 nM within 12 s of exposure to laminin and constitutive nitric oxide production is sustained for 1 min.

In contrast, C16, a synthetic peptide derived from the laminin-1-gamma chain, is shown here to promote PC12 cell attachment, but not neurite outgrowth.

Uninephrectomized Wistar rats treated for 7 days with olive oil, cyclosporine (30 mg/kg), nifedipine (3 mg/kg), and nifedipine+cyclosporine were studied. In vehicle and cyclosporine groups, the gene expression of the neuronal, inducible, and endothelial nitric oxide synthases in cerebellum, heart, intestine, liver, renal cortex, and medulla was evaluated. The administration of cyclosporine was associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in renal cortex and liver, and a decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in renal medulla. The mRNA levels of the 3 nitric oxide synthase isoforms were not affected in any other tissue. Nifedipine did not alter nitric oxide synthase expression in the control group but prevented changes associated with cyclosporine.

We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure. Microinjection of a high dose (100 nmol) of sodium nitroprusside decreased arterial pressure and inhibited spontaneous respiration with concomitant production of peroxynitrite, a strong cytotoxic oxidant. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of L-glutamate were inhibited after preinjection of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol) were inhibited after preinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. They also indicate that nitric oxide may stimulate neurons both through activation of the nitric oxide cyclic GMP pathway and through modulation of glutamate receptor stimulation, and therefore, increase arterial pressure in rats."

Initial uncontrolled studies indicated that inhalation of nitric oxide resulted in a reduction in pulmonary hypertension, with improvement in oxygenation, but no change in the systemic vascular resistance. There have now been a number of randomised trials performed exploring the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide. These trials have demonstrated that in at term or near term infants, inhaled nitric oxide reduces the combined end point of death or the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The significant effect seems due to the reduced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation requirement. No such beneficial effect has been consistently reported in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Randomised trials have failed to highlight long-term positive results in preterm infants. Inhaled nitric oxide has side effects, although those due to nitrogen dioxide and methaemoglobin formation can be minimised by appropriate nitric oxide delivery. It is important to use the smallest effective nitric oxide dose, continuous nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide monitoring and frequent methaemoglobin analyses.

The incubation of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin and nitrite with platelets caused significant elevation of nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels possibly due to the activation of nitrite reductase.

Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm.

To study the influence of cavitation and gas content on the formation and growth of stable gas bubbles, a mock circulatory loop, which employed a Medtronic-Hall pyrolytic carbon disk valve in the mitral position, was used. A high-speed video camera allowed observation of cavitation and gas bubble release on the inflow valve surfaces as a function of cavitation intensity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, while an ultrasonic monitoring system scanned the aortic outflow tract to quantify gas bubble production by calculating the gray scale levels of the images. In the absence of cavitation, no stable gas bubbles were formed. When gas bubbles were formed, they were first seen a few milliseconds after and in the vicinity of cavitation collapse. The volume of the gas bubbles detected in the aortic track increased with both increased CO2 and increased cavitation intensity. No correlation was observed between O2 concentration and bubble volume. We conclude that cavitation is an essential precursor to stable gas bubble formation, and CO2, the most soluble blood gas, is the major component of stable gas bubbles."

As a peroxidase, DHP is capable of converting 2,4,6-trihalophenols to the corresponding 2,6-dihaloquinones in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Only the structure of the apo form of CcmE is known; the heme-binding site has been modeled on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of H130. We have determined the reduction potential of CcmE, which suggests that heme bound to CcmE is not as exposed to solvent as was initially thought. Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130. However, mutation of Y134 affected neither heme attachment to CcmE nor cytochrome c maturation, suggesting that heme binding and release from CcmE are hydrophobically driven and relatively indifferent to axial ligation."

Comparison of the results provides interesting insights about the role of highly conserved Arg38 and His42 residues in the chemical features of HRP, underlying its biological activity which initiates with Compound0 (Cpd0). In the WT-HRP enzyme current molecular dynamics simulations show, for the first time, that Arg38 residue: i) prevents the entrance of water inside the reaction cavity, hence providing a hydrophobic reactive scenario, ii) it maintains the distance between His42 and heme-H(2)O(2) complex suitable for the occurrence of proton transfer reaction leading, thereafter, to heme-H(2)O(2) disruption according to Poulos-Kraut mechanism. On the other hand, R38L mutant can be considered as a \"wet enzyme\" where the presence of water solvent molecules in the heme reaction pocket, unfavoring the initial heme-H(2)O(2) complex formation, decreases the catalytic efficiency in agreement with experimental kinetics measurements. Furthermore, we note that Arg38Leu mutation pushes the His42 residue far from the heme-H(2)O(2) complex, making unlikely a direct proton transfer and suggesting that, in the mutant, a solvent water molecule could be involved in the first step of the Poulos-Kraut mechanism."

Below about 200 K in 75% glycerol/water solvent, ligand rebinding occurs from the heme pocket and is nonexponential in time. The kinetics is explained by a distribution, g(H), of the enthalpic barrier of height H between the pocket and the bound state. Above 170 K rebinding slows markedly. Previously we interpreted the slowing as a \"matrix process\" resulting from the ligand entering the protein matrix before rebinding. Experiments on band III, an inhomogeneously broadened charge-transfer band near 760 nm (approximately 13,000 cm-1) in the photolyzed state (Mb*) of (carbonmonoxy)myoglobin (MbCO), force us to reinterpret the data. Kinetic hole-burning measurements on band III in Mb* establish a relation between the position of a homogeneous component of band III and the barrier H. Since band III is red-shifted by 116 cm-1 in Mb* compared with Mb, the relation implies that the barrier in relaxed Mb is 12 kJ/mol higher than in Mb*. The slowing of the rebinding kinetics above 170 K hence is caused by the relaxation Mb*----Mb, as suggested by Agmon and Hopfield [(1983) J. Chem. Phys. 79, 2042-2053]. This conclusion is supported by a fit to the rebinding data between 160 and 290 K which indicates that the entire distribution g(H) shifts. Above about 200 K, equilibrium fluctuations among conformational substates open pathways for the ligands through the protein matrix and also narrow the rate distribution. The protein relaxations and fluctuations are nonexponential in time and non-Arrhenius in temperature, suggesting a collective nature for these protein motions. The relaxation Mb*----Mb is essentially independent of the solvent viscosity, implying that this motion involves internal parts of the protein. The protein fluctuations responsible for the opening of the pathways, however, depend strongly on the solvent viscosity, suggesting that a large part of the protein participates. While the detailed studies concern MbCO, similar data have been obtained for MbO2 and CO binding to the beta chains of human hemoglobin and hemoglobin Z\u00fcrich. The results show that protein dynamics is essential for protein function and that the association coefficient for binding from the solvent at physiological temperatures in all these heme proteins is governed by the barrier at the heme."

CYP153AM.aq. -CPRBM3 is an artificial fusion construct consisting of the heme domain from Marinobacter aquaeolei and the reductase domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium. It has the ability to hydroxylate medium- and long-chain fatty acids selectively at their terminal positions. However, the activity of this interesting P450 construct needs to be improved for applications in industrial processes. For this purpose, the design of mutant libraries including two consecutive steps of mutagenesis is demonstrated. Targeted positions and residues chosen for substitution were based on semi-rational protein design after creation of a homology model of the heme domain of CYP153AM.aq. , sequence alignments, and docking studies. Site-directed mutagenesis was the preferred method employed to address positions within the binding pocket, whereas diversity was created with the aid of a degenerate codon for amino acids located at the substrate entrance channel. Combining the successful variants led to the identification of a double variant-G307A/S233G-that showed alterations of one position within the binding pocket and one position located in the substrate access channel. This double variant showed twofold increased activity relative to the wild type for the terminal hydroxylation of medium-chain-length fatty acids. This variant furthermore showed improved activity towards short- and long-chain fatty acids and enhanced stability in the presence of higher concentrations of fatty acids."

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family."

Here, we investigate the role of nitric oxide in the signaling mechanism of laminin-mediated neurite outgrowth in the PC12 cell line. Within 8 s of exposure to laminin, PC12 cells produce nitric oxide. Peak laminin-induced nitric oxide levels reach 8 nM within 12 s of exposure to laminin and constitutive nitric oxide production is sustained for 1 min. A neurite outgrowth promoting synthetic peptide (AG73), derived from the laminin-1-alpha globular domain, also stimulated nitric oxide release. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 1-NAME, prevents the formation of nitric oxide and here, 1-NAME inhibited both laminin-mediated and AG73-mediated neurite outgrowth by 88 and 95%, respectively. In contrast, C16, a synthetic peptide derived from the laminin-1-gamma chain, is shown here to promote PC12 cell attachment, but not neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the C16 peptide did not activate nitric oxide release, suggesting that laminin-induced nitric oxide release in PC12 cells is associated only with neurite outgrowth promoting laminin domains and signals. In addition, the data here show that the nitric oxide released by PC12 cells in response to laminin is required as a part of the mechanism of laminin-mediated neurite outgrowth."

We have previously shown that cyclosporine nephrotoxicity alters kidney nitric oxide synthase mRNA pattern of expression. To determine if nitric oxide synthase expression changes are mediated directly by cyclosporine or by secondary hemodynamic alterations induced by cyclosporine, we evaluated if these effects are tissue specific and if nifedipine-induced vasodilation prevents these alterations. Uninephrectomized Wistar rats treated for 7 days with olive oil, cyclosporine (30 mg/kg), nifedipine (3 mg/kg), and nifedipine+cyclosporine were studied. In vehicle and cyclosporine groups, the gene expression of the neuronal, inducible, and endothelial nitric oxide synthases in cerebellum, heart, intestine, liver, renal cortex, and medulla was evaluated. The administration of cyclosporine was associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in renal cortex and liver, and a decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in renal medulla. The mRNA levels of the 3 nitric oxide synthase isoforms were not affected in any other tissue. Nifedipine did not alter nitric oxide synthase expression in the control group but prevented changes associated with cyclosporine. These results suggest that cyclosporine-induced changes in the pattern of expression of the nitric oxide synthases may be secondary to its hemodynamic effects."

Previous studies have reported conflicting results for the roles of nitric oxide in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a major center that regulates sympathetic and cardiovascular activities. We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure. Microinjection of a high dose (100 nmol) of sodium nitroprusside decreased arterial pressure and inhibited spontaneous respiration with concomitant production of peroxynitrite, a strong cytotoxic oxidant. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of L-glutamate were inhibited after preinjection of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol) were inhibited after preinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. They also indicate that nitric oxide may stimulate neurons both through activation of the nitric oxide cyclic GMP pathway and through modulation of glutamate receptor stimulation, and therefore, increase arterial pressure in rats."

It can occur as a primary condition or secondary to a variety of other diseases. Endogenous nitric oxide is an important modulator of vascular tone in pulmonary circulation. Initial uncontrolled studies indicated that inhalation of nitric oxide resulted in a reduction in pulmonary hypertension, with improvement in oxygenation, but no change in the systemic vascular resistance. There have now been a number of randomised trials performed exploring the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide. These trials have demonstrated that in at term or near term infants, inhaled nitric oxide reduces the combined end point of death or the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The significant effect seems due to the reduced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation requirement. No such beneficial effect has been consistently reported in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Randomised trials have failed to highlight long-term positive results in preterm infants. Inhaled nitric oxide has side effects, although those due to nitrogen dioxide and methaemoglobin formation can be minimised by appropriate nitric oxide delivery. It is important to use the smallest effective nitric oxide dose, continuous nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide monitoring and frequent methaemoglobin analyses. Careful patient selection should be undertaken, avoiding those at high risk of haemorrhagic complications. Longer term follow-up studies are required to determine the real risk:benefit ratio of inhaled nitric oxide treatment."

The activation of platelets nitric oxide synthase by 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin has already been demonstrated by us. Also, there are reports that certain proteins such as cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochrome P-450 are endowed with the nitrite reductase activity in mammalian cells. Keeping these facts in view, we turned our attention to probe whether 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin could alter the levels of nitric oxide independent of the action of nitric oxide synthase in the human platelets model. The incubation of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin and nitrite with platelets caused significant elevation of nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels possibly due to the activation of nitrite reductase. Several polyphenolic acetates were similarly found to activate the nitrite reductase in tune with their affinities as substrate to CRTAase. N-omega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, failed to reverse such an effect of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin. Clotrimazole which is known to be an inhibitor of nitrite reductase, effectively abolished the 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin mediated enhancement of nitric oxide levels in platelets as well as the nitric oxide mediated effects; such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels as well as adenosine diphospate induced platelets aggregation due to nitrite."

The electrical and optical properties of zinc oxide film vary in the presence of nitric oxide. This effect was utilized to prepare biochemical sensors with transduction based on surface plasmon resonance. Due to the refractive index of the transparent zinc oxide film that was deposited on the gold film, however, changes will be observed in the surface plasmon resonance spectra. For this reason, the thickness of zinc oxide film will be investigated and determined in this study. The interaction of nitric oxide with a 20 nm zinc oxide layer on gold leads to the shift of the resonance angle. The analysis on the reflectance intensity of light demonstrates that such effect is caused by the variation of conductivity and permittivity of zinc oxide film. Finally, a shift in surface plasmon resonance angle was measured in 25 ppm nitric oxide at 180 C and a calibration curve of nitride oxide concentration versus response intensity was successfully obtained in the range of 250 to 1000 ppm nitric oxide at lower temperature of 150 C.

This paper describes a comprehensive control system applicable to a large class of patients. This system controls the end-tidal oxygen and anesthetic gas concentrations, and the circuit volume. The CCA process was modeled by writing mass balance equations. Simplifying assumptions yielded a bilinear single-input-single-output model for the anesthetic gas concentration and a bilinear multiple-input-multiple-output model for the circuit volume and oxygen concentration. One-step-ahead controllers were used to control these two subsystems. Simulations showed that the control performance was most sensitive to the gas uptakes. Three independent, least-mean-squares estimation schemes were implemented to estimate the uptakes of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and anesthetic gas. These estimates were used in the control law and resulted in explicit adaptive control. The performance of the adaptive controller was compared to that of a fixed controller (with precalculated gas uptakes) in five animal experiments. The adaptive controller performed better than the fixed controller in all cases. The most significant difference was in the anesthetic gas response time 3.6 +/- 0.70 min for adaptive control and 7.04 +/- 5.62 min for fixed control.

As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."

Alanine insertions in the vicinity of the heme-binding histidine (which we showed by NMR do not perturb the protein fold) strikingly abolish formation of both holo-CcmE and cytochrome c, whereas previously reported point mutations of residues adjacent to H130 gave only a partial attenuation. The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130.

Furthermore, we note that Arg38Leu mutation pushes the His42 residue far from the heme-H(2)O(2) complex, making unlikely a direct proton transfer and suggesting that, in the mutant, a solvent water molecule could be involved in the first step of the Poulos-Kraut mechanism."

Below about 200 K in 75% glycerol/water solvent, ligand rebinding occurs from the heme pocket and is nonexponential in time. The kinetics is explained by a distribution, g(H), of the enthalpic barrier of height H between the pocket and the bound state. Above 170 K rebinding slows markedly. Previously we interpreted the slowing as a \"matrix process\" resulting from the ligand entering the protein matrix before rebinding. Experiments on band III, an inhomogeneously broadened charge-transfer band near 760 nm (approximately 13,000 cm-1) in the photolyzed state (Mb*) of (carbonmonoxy)myoglobin (MbCO), force us to reinterpret the data. Kinetic hole-burning measurements on band III in Mb* establish a relation between the position of a homogeneous component of band III and the barrier H. Since band III is red-shifted by 116 cm-1 in Mb* compared with Mb, the relation implies that the barrier in relaxed Mb is 12 kJ/mol higher than in Mb*. The slowing of the rebinding kinetics above 170 K hence is caused by the relaxation Mb*----Mb, as suggested by Agmon and Hopfield [(1983) J. Chem. Phys. 79, 2042-2053]. This conclusion is supported by a fit to the rebinding data between 160 and 290 K which indicates that the entire distribution g(H) shifts. Above about 200 K, equilibrium fluctuations among conformational substates open pathways for the ligands through the protein matrix and also narrow the rate distribution. The protein relaxations and fluctuations are nonexponential in time and non-Arrhenius in temperature, suggesting a collective nature for these protein motions. The relaxation Mb*----Mb is essentially independent of the solvent viscosity, implying that this motion involves internal parts of the protein. The protein fluctuations responsible for the opening of the pathways, however, depend strongly on the solvent viscosity, suggesting that a large part of the protein participates. While the detailed studies concern MbCO, similar data have been obtained for MbO2 and CO binding to the beta chains of human hemoglobin and hemoglobin Z\u00fcrich. The results show that protein dynamics is essential for protein function and that the association coefficient for binding from the solvent at physiological temperatures in all these heme proteins is governed by the barrier at the heme."

The chemically challenging activation and oxidation of non-activated C-H bonds can be achieved with cytochrome P450 enzymes. CYP153AM.aq. -CPRBM3 is an artificial fusion construct consisting of the heme domain from Marinobacter aquaeolei and the reductase domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium. It has the ability to hydroxylate medium- and long-chain fatty acids selectively at their terminal positions. However, the activity of this interesting P450 construct needs to be improved for applications in industrial processes. For this purpose, the design of mutant libraries including two consecutive steps of mutagenesis is demonstrated. Targeted positions and residues chosen for substitution were based on semi-rational protein design after creation of a homology model of the heme domain of CYP153AM.aq. , sequence alignments, and docking studies. Site-directed mutagenesis was the preferred method employed to address positions within the binding pocket, whereas diversity was created with the aid of a degenerate codon for amino acids located at the substrate entrance channel. Combining the successful variants led to the identification of a double variant-G307A/S233G-that showed alterations of one position within the binding pocket and one position located in the substrate access channel. This double variant showed twofold increased activity relative to the wild type for the terminal hydroxylation of medium-chain-length fatty acids. This variant furthermore showed improved activity towards short- and long-chain fatty acids and enhanced stability in the presence of higher concentrations of fatty acids."

Here, we report that all heme biosynthases and two heme oxygenases, which initiate heme degradation, are dynamically expressed during Xenopus embryonic development. All heme synthases, with the exception of aminolevulinic acid synthase 2, are maternally expressed. At neurula stage, heme synthases are expressed in the developing neural tissue and in migrating neural crest cells. At the swimming tadpole stage, expression of heme synthases can be detected in multiple lineages, including eyes, neural crest cells, developing central nervous system, ventral blood island, pronephron, and pronephric tubule. Similar to heme synthases, heme oxygenases are expressed maternally. Zygotic expression of heme oxygenases is mainly restricted to the developing neural and neural crest lineages. Unlike heme synthases, heme oxygenases are not expressed in the ventral blood island and are expressed at a very low level in the pronephron and pronephric tubule. This indicates that heme metabolism may play important roles during development."

Peak laminin-induced nitric oxide levels reach 8 nM within 12 s of exposure to laminin and constitutive nitric oxide production is sustained for 1 min. A neurite outgrowth promoting synthetic peptide (AG73), derived from the laminin-1-alpha globular domain, also stimulated nitric oxide release.

In contrast, C16, a synthetic peptide derived from the laminin-1-gamma chain, is shown here to promote PC12 cell attachment, but not neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the C16 peptide did not activate nitric oxide release, suggesting that laminin-induced nitric oxide release in PC12 cells is associated only with neurite outgrowth promoting laminin domains and signals.

To determine if nitric oxide synthase expression changes are mediated directly by cyclosporine or by secondary hemodynamic alterations induced by cyclosporine, we evaluated if these effects are tissue specific and if nifedipine-induced vasodilation prevents these alterations. Uninephrectomized Wistar rats treated for 7 days with olive oil, cyclosporine (30 mg/kg), nifedipine (3 mg/kg), and nifedipine+cyclosporine were studied. In vehicle and cyclosporine groups, the gene expression of the neuronal, inducible, and endothelial nitric oxide synthases in cerebellum, heart, intestine, liver, renal cortex, and medulla was evaluated. The administration of cyclosporine was associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in renal cortex and liver, and a decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in renal medulla. The mRNA levels of the 3 nitric oxide synthase isoforms were not affected in any other tissue. Nifedipine did not alter nitric oxide synthase expression in the control group but prevented changes associated with cyclosporine.

Previous studies have reported conflicting results for the roles of nitric oxide in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a major center that regulates sympathetic and cardiovascular activities. We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure. Microinjection of a high dose (100 nmol) of sodium nitroprusside decreased arterial pressure and inhibited spontaneous respiration with concomitant production of peroxynitrite, a strong cytotoxic oxidant. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of L-glutamate were inhibited after preinjection of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol) were inhibited after preinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. They also indicate that nitric oxide may stimulate neurons both through activation of the nitric oxide cyclic GMP pathway and through modulation of glutamate receptor stimulation, and therefore, increase arterial pressure in rats."

There have now been a number of randomised trials performed exploring the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide. These trials have demonstrated that in at term or near term infants, inhaled nitric oxide reduces the combined end point of death or the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The significant effect seems due to the reduced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation requirement. No such beneficial effect has been consistently reported in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Randomised trials have failed to highlight long-term positive results in preterm infants. Inhaled nitric oxide has side effects, although those due to nitrogen dioxide and methaemoglobin formation can be minimised by appropriate nitric oxide delivery. It is important to use the smallest effective nitric oxide dose, continuous nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide monitoring and frequent methaemoglobin analyses.

Also, there are reports that certain proteins such as cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochrome P-450 are endowed with the nitrite reductase activity in mammalian cells.

The incubation of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin and nitrite with platelets caused significant elevation of nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels possibly due to the activation of nitrite reductase. Several polyphenolic acetates were similarly found to activate the nitrite reductase in tune with their affinities as substrate to CRTAase. N-omega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, failed to reverse such an effect of 7,8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin.

Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."

The heme iron coordinating residue Y134 proved to be strictly required for axial ligation of both ferrous and ferric heme. These results indicate the existence of a conformationally well-defined heme pocket that involves amino acids located in the proximity of H130.

The kinetics is explained by a distribution, g(H), of the enthalpic barrier of height H between the pocket and the bound state. Above 170 K rebinding slows markedly. Previously we interpreted the slowing as a \"matrix process\" resulting from the ligand entering the protein matrix before rebinding. Experiments on band III, an inhomogeneously broadened charge-transfer band near 760 nm (approximately 13,000 cm-1) in the photolyzed state (Mb*) of (carbonmonoxy)myoglobin (MbCO), force us to reinterpret the data. Kinetic hole-burning measurements on band III in Mb* establish a relation between the position of a homogeneous component of band III and the barrier H. Since band III is red-shifted by 116 cm-1 in Mb* compared with Mb, the relation implies that the barrier in relaxed Mb is 12 kJ/mol higher than in Mb*. The slowing of the rebinding kinetics above 170 K hence is caused by the relaxation Mb*----Mb, as suggested by Agmon and Hopfield [(1983) J. Chem. Phys. 79, 2042-2053]. This conclusion is supported by a fit to the rebinding data between 160 and 290 K which indicates that the entire distribution g(H) shifts. Above about 200 K, equilibrium fluctuations among conformational substates open pathways for the ligands through the protein matrix and also narrow the rate distribution.

The results show that protein dynamics is essential for protein function and that the association coefficient for binding from the solvent at physiological temperatures in all these heme proteins is governed by the barrier at the heme."

The electrical and optical properties of zinc oxide film vary in the presence of nitric oxide. This effect was utilized to prepare biochemical sensors with transduction based on surface plasmon resonance. Due to the refractive index of the transparent zinc oxide film that was deposited on the gold film, however, changes will be observed in the surface plasmon resonance spectra. For this reason, the thickness of zinc oxide film will be investigated and determined in this study. The interaction of nitric oxide with a 20 nm zinc oxide layer on gold leads to the shift of the resonance angle. The analysis on the reflectance intensity of light demonstrates that such effect is caused by the variation of conductivity and permittivity of zinc oxide film. Finally, a shift in surface plasmon resonance angle was measured in 25 ppm nitric oxide at 180 C and a calibration curve of nitride oxide concentration versus response intensity was successfully obtained in the range of 250 to 1000 ppm nitric oxide at lower temperature of 150 C. Moreover, these effects are quasi-reversible."

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive.

From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity.

Peak laminin-induced nitric oxide levels reach 8 nM within 12 s of exposure to laminin and constitutive nitric oxide production is sustained for 1 min. A neurite outgrowth promoting synthetic peptide (AG73), derived from the laminin-1-alpha globular domain, also stimulated nitric oxide release. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 1-NAME, prevents the formation of nitric oxide and here, 1-NAME inhibited both laminin-mediated and AG73-mediated neurite outgrowth by 88 and 95%, respectively. In contrast, C16, a synthetic peptide derived from the laminin-1-gamma chain, is shown here to promote PC12 cell attachment, but not neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, the C16 peptide did not activate nitric oxide release, suggesting that laminin-induced nitric oxide release in PC12 cells is associated only with neurite outgrowth promoting laminin domains and signals. In addition, the data here show that the nitric oxide released by PC12 cells in response to laminin is required as a part of the mechanism of laminin-mediated neurite outgrowth."

To determine if nitric oxide synthase expression changes are mediated directly by cyclosporine or by secondary hemodynamic alterations induced by cyclosporine, we evaluated if these effects are tissue specific and if nifedipine-induced vasodilation prevents these alterations. Uninephrectomized Wistar rats treated for 7 days with olive oil, cyclosporine (30 mg/kg), nifedipine (3 mg/kg), and nifedipine+cyclosporine were studied. In vehicle and cyclosporine groups, the gene expression of the neuronal, inducible, and endothelial nitric oxide synthases in cerebellum, heart, intestine, liver, renal cortex, and medulla was evaluated. The administration of cyclosporine was associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA levels in renal cortex and liver, and a decrease in inducible nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in renal medulla. The mRNA levels of the 3 nitric oxide synthase isoforms were not affected in any other tissue. Nifedipine did not alter nitric oxide synthase expression in the control group but prevented changes associated with cyclosporine. These results suggest that cyclosporine-induced changes in the pattern of expression of the nitric oxide synthases may be secondary to its hemodynamic effects."

Previous studies have reported conflicting results for the roles of nitric oxide in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, a major center that regulates sympathetic and cardiovascular activities. We hypothesized that in this region, nitric oxide may have a biphasic effect on cardiovascular activity. Microinjection of a low dose (1 nmol) of a nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or a cyclic GMP agonist 8-bromocyclic GMP into this area increased arterial pressure, whereas injection of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor methylene blue decreased arterial pressure. Microinjection of a high dose (100 nmol) of sodium nitroprusside decreased arterial pressure and inhibited spontaneous respiration with concomitant production of peroxynitrite, a strong cytotoxic oxidant. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of L-glutamate were inhibited after preinjection of Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue. Increases in arterial pressure caused by microinjection of sodium nitroprusside (1 nmol) were inhibited after preinjection of a glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate. These results suggest that low doses of nitric oxide may increase arterial pressure, whereas high doses of nitric oxide may decrease arterial pressure through cytotoxic effects in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. They also indicate that nitric oxide may stimulate neurons both through activation of the nitric oxide cyclic GMP pathway and through modulation of glutamate receptor stimulation, and therefore, increase arterial pressure in rats."

It can occur as a primary condition or secondary to a variety of other diseases. Endogenous nitric oxide is an important modulator of vascular tone in pulmonary circulation. Initial uncontrolled studies indicated that inhalation of nitric oxide resulted in a reduction in pulmonary hypertension, with improvement in oxygenation, but no change in the systemic vascular resistance. There have now been a number of randomised trials performed exploring the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide. These trials have demonstrated that in at term or near term infants, inhaled nitric oxide reduces the combined end point of death or the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The significant effect seems due to the reduced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation requirement. No such beneficial effect has been consistently reported in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Randomised trials have failed to highlight long-term positive results in preterm infants. Inhaled nitric oxide has side effects, although those due to nitrogen dioxide and methaemoglobin formation can be minimised by appropriate nitric oxide delivery. It is important to use the smallest effective nitric oxide dose, continuous nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide monitoring and frequent methaemoglobin analyses. Careful patient selection should be undertaken, avoiding those at high risk of haemorrhagic complications. Longer term follow-up studies are required to determine the real risk:benefit ratio of inhaled nitric oxide treatment."

Herein, we elucidate the nature and dynamics of LH using genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae We find that the subcellular distribution of LH is heterogeneous; the cytosol maintains LH at \u223c20-40 nM, whereas the mitochondria and nucleus maintain it at concentrations below 2.5 nM. Further, we find that the signaling molecule nitric oxide can initiate the rapid mobilization of heme in the cytosol and nucleus from certain thiol-containing factors. We also find that the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase constitutes a major cellular heme buffer, and is responsible for maintaining the activity of the heme-dependent nuclear transcription factor heme activator protein (Hap1p). Altogether, we demonstrate that the heme sensors can be used to reveal fundamental aspects of heme trafficking and dynamics and can be used across multiple organisms, including Escherichia coli, yeast, and human cell lines."

As a peroxidase, DHP is capable of converting 2,4,6-trihalophenols to the corresponding 2,6-dihaloquinones in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. As a hemoglobin, DHP cycles between the oxy and deoxy states as it reversibly binds oxygen for storage. Here, it is reported that the distal histidine, His55, exhibits conformational flexibility in the deoxy form and is consequently observed in two solvent-exposed conformations more than 9.5 A away from the heme. These conformations are analogous to the open conformation of sperm whale myoglobin. The heme iron in deoxy ferrous DHP is five-coordinate and has an out-of-plane displacement of 0.25 A from the heme plane. The observation of five-coordinate heme iron with His55 in a remote solvent-exposed conformation is consistent with the hypothesis that His55 interacts with heme iron ligands through hydrogen bonding in the closed conformation. Since His55 is also displaced by the binding of 4-iodophenol in an internal pocket, these results provide new insight into the correlation between heme iron ligation, molecular binding in the distal pocket and the conformation of the distal histidine in DHP."
