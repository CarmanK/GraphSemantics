Diabetes is one of most difficult challenges facing the healthcare industry today. One of the primary afflictions of diabetic patients is peripheral neuropathy (loss of sensation in the foot). As a direct result of this condition, the likelihood of ulcer increases which in many cases leads to to amputation. We have developed a wireless electronic orthotics composed of lightweight embedded systems and non-invasive sensors which can be used by diabetic patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy. Our proposed system monitors feet motion and pressure distribution beneath the feet in real-time and classifies the state of the patient.

These functions are anion transport, ankyrin binding, and generation of senescent cell antigen, an aging antigen that terminates the life of cells. Structural similarity of brain and erythroid band 3 is suggested by the reaction of antibodies to synthetic peptides of erythroid band 3 with brain band 3, the inhibition of anion transport by the same inhibitors, and an equal degree of inhibition of brain and erythrocyte anion transport by synthetic peptides of erythroid band 3 (pep-ANION 2, residues 588-602; pep-COOH, residues 812-827; pep-COOH-N6, residues 813-818). One of these segments, pep-COOH, contains antigenic determinants of senescent cell antigen.

A circular-type, mm-scale electrode with the same diameter as the band-type microelectrode was also made with an electrode area that was 5000 times larger than the band-type microelectrode. By comparing the amperometric signals of 3,5,3',5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) samples at different optical density (OD) values, the band-type microelectrode was determined to be 9 times more sensitive than the circular-type electrode. The properties of the circular-type and the band-type electrodes (e.g., the shape of their cyclic voltammograms, the type of diffusion layer used, and the diffusion layer thickness per unit electrode area) were characterized according to their electrode area using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. From these simulations, the band-type electrode was estimated to have the conventional microelectrode properties, even when the electrode area was 100 times larger than a conventional circular-type electrode. These results show that both the geometry and the area of an electrode can influence the properties of the electrode. Finally, amperometric analysis based on a band-type electrode was applied to commercial ELISA kits to analyze human hepatitis B surface antigen (hHBsAg) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies.

This review emphasizes a structural approach that describes the cellular and extracellular components with known anatomical, biochemical, and physical properties that make them candidates for these contractile and elastic components. Classical models of contractile and elastic elements and their underlying assumptions are presented. Mechanical properties of cardiac and skeletal muscle are compared and contrasted and then related to ultrastructure. Information from these approaches leads to the conclusion that the Z band is essential for muscle contraction. Our review of Z band structure shows the Z band at the interface where extracellular components meet the cell surface. The Z band is also the interface from cell surface to myofibril, from extra-myofibrillar to myofibril, and finally from sarcomere to sarcomere. Our studies of Z band in defined physiologic states show that this lattice is an integral part of the contractile elements and can function as an elastic component. The Z band is a complex dynamic lattice uniquely suited to play several roles in muscle contraction."

In conclusion, further research with more subjects would now be warranted in order to test the findings of this program for the prevention of low back in golfers as piloted in this case report."

Ten endurance-trained men performed 2 trials, each involving a 10-min warm-up at 60% VO2max followed by a 30-min run. The run was performed on an automated treadmill that allowed the spontaneous selection of speeds without manual input. Participants were asked to run at speeds that equated to a rating of perceived exertion of 15, mouth rinsing with either a 6% CHO or taste-matched placebo (PLA) solution. In addition to recording self-selected speeds and total distance covered the authors assessed the runners' subjective feelings. The total distance covered was greater during the CHO than during the PLA trial (p < .05). Faster speeds selected during the first 5 min of exercise corresponded with enhanced feelings of pleasure when mouth rinsing with the CHO solution. Mouth rinsing with a CHO solution increased total distance covered during a self-selected 30-min run in comparison with mouth rinsing with a color- and taste-matched placebo."

For each subject, the displacement of the lower interincisal point, the path of the condylar reference point, the degree of rotation around the three orthogonal rotational axes, and the relative contribution of translation and rotation were calculated during all movement of mouth opening and closing. The distance covered by the interincisor point and the rotational angle about the transverse axis at maximum mouth opening were larger in men than in women, but the difference cancelled after correcting for mandibular radius in the sagittal plane; mandibular rotation was always larger than translation, but never approaching 100%; opening and closing translations were similar within sex, but their paths were longer in men than in women (P < 0.05); rotational angles around vertical and sagittal axes were negligible; the linear correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was minor and not significant. In normal subjects, mouth opening and closing as modeled at the interincisor point was determined more by mandibular rotation than by translation, but in no occasion a pure rotation was found. The percentage rotation was not identical during mouth opening and closing; female and male paths were not totally coincident; no correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was found."

Under baseline conditions maximum flow via the nose was lower than that via the mouth in the upper 50-60% of the VC on expiration and throughout the VC on inspiration. The mean ratio of maximum inspiratory to maximum expiratory flow at mid-VC was 1.38 during mouth breathing and 0.62 during nasal breathing. Inspiratory flow limitation with no increase in flow through the nose as driving pressure was increased above a critical value (usually between 12 and 30 cmH2O) was found in all six subjects studied. Stenting the alae nasi in seven subjects increased peak flow via the nose from a mean of 3.49 to 4.32 l/s on inspiration and from 4.83 to 5.61 l/s on expiration. Topical application of an alpha-adrenergic agonist in seven subjects increased mean peak nasal flow on inspiration from 3.25 to 3.89 l/s and on expiration from 5.03 to 7.09 l/s. Further increases in peak flow occurred with subsequent alan stenting. With the combination of stenting and topical mucosal vasoconstriction, nasal peak flow on expiration reached 81% and, on inspiration, 79% of corresponding peak flows via the mouth. The results demonstrate that narrowing of the alar vestibule and the state of the mucosal vasculature both influence maximum flow through the nose; under optimal conditions, nasal flow capacity is close to that via the mouth."

One of the most widely employed strategies for assessing social skill has been role-play tests: simulated social interactions that are videotaped for subsequent behavioral coding. There has been considerable discussion of the validity of the approach in the literature, but there has not been adequate consideration of other psychometric characteristics of role-play tests. This paper examines the psychometric characteristics of a representative role-play measure: the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC). Data from 5 large schizophrenia studies that included the MASC were examined: a study of victimization in women who abuse drugs, a study of health care among people with diabetes, a study of vocational outcomes, a study of social skill among drug abusers, and a clinical trial comparing two antipsychotic medications. Data were examined in terms of five questions: (1) Can role-play scenes be rated reliably? (2) How are role-play ratings distributed across populations? (3) How many and which behaviors should be rated? (4) How many role-play scenes are required? (5) Is role-play behavior temporally stable? Overall, the data suggest that the MASC, and by implication other similar role-play procedures, does have good psychometric properties. However, several things often taken for granted in the literature warrant careful consideration in the design of research using role-play. Implications of the results for design of research are discussed."

(2) Boys prefer to play with their fathers, whereas, girls prefer to play with their mothers. The previous studies by the author on outdoor play interactions in Japanese families suggest that these tendencies may be an adaptation to hunter-gatherer lives. In the present study, this suggestion was investigated by examining whether (1) fathers tend to teach their sons how to fish more frequently than they teach their daughters, and (2) boys taught fishing skills by their fathers tend to have better fishing skills than other same-aged boys taught fishing skills by persons other than their fathers. The experiment was performed by obtaining information through a questionnaire from third and fifth grade students in four elementary schools. The results indicate the followings. (1) Fathers tend to teach their sons fishing more often than they tend to teach their daughters.

The proportions of decentred and decontextualized acts, action integrations and play themes, increased linearly with age. Changes in substitutive and inventive actions were, however, more minor than expected. Single-scheme combinations did not reveal any essential aspect of the development of children's symbolic competence. In this sense, multischeme combinations were more important in revealing the children's way of organizing toy material. Linear age trends were not found for language measures. The use of decentred utterances, language integrations and linguistically expressed themes were individual-specific rather than age-related. Issues for studying pretend play in language-impaired groups are also suggested."

We report a retrospective analysis of 77 allogeneic bone marrow transplantation recipients who received simultaneous upper and lower GI tract biopsies. Upper GI GVHD was found in 44% of patients, of whom 59% also had a positive lower GI tract biopsy (P less than 0.001). Thirty-five percent of the patients with no clinical evidence of lower GI tract GVHD had symptomatic upper GI GVHD confirmed histologically. Patients with and without upper GI GVHD had no significant difference in their clinical symptoms or in their endoscopic findings. We found an association between upper GI and skin GVHD greater than stage I (P = 0.05), a trend to concordance between upper GI GVHD and clinical GVHD in the lower GI tract (P = 0.08), and with the overall clinical GVHD grade (P = 0.08) but no association with clinical liver involvement. Of these 77 patients, 16% had their treatment for acute GVHD changed to include systemic immunosuppression as a result of the upper GI endoscopic biopsy. In addition, 71% had other enteric pathology identified that required specific therapy. These data suggest that upper GI GVHD cannot be diagnosed accurately from its clinical presentation nor inferred from lower GI symptoms or from extraintestinal GVHD.

Here, we quantitated HMG CoA reductase activity after acute and chronic barrier disruption in the upper and lower layers of murine epidermis. In unperturbed epidermis, 13 and 87% of enzyme activity localized to the upper and lower epidermis, respectively, with the majority of activity in the stratum basale. Acute barrier disruption with either acetone or sodium dodecylsulfate provoked an increase in HMG CoA reductase activity (54% and 30%) in the lower layers, but only a small change in the upper layers. However, the activation state of the enzyme was increased 50% in the upper epidermis. Correction of barrier function by occlusion with an impermeable Latex wrap prevented the increase both in enzyme activity and activation state. After chronic barrier disruption; i.e., essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD) diet, HMG CoA reductase activity was increased in the upper epidermis (161%); a change prevented by occlusion. These results show: (1) that HMG CoA reductase activity is present in both the upper and lower cell layers; (2) that acute insults to barrier integrity stimulate enzyme activity in both the upper and lower epidermis; and (3) that chronic insults provoke an increase in enzyme activity in the upper layers. These studies provide further insights into the linkage of the permeability barrier with epidermal cholesterol metabolism."

However, the lack of appropriate water quality standards or guidelines has hampered the appropriate grey water reuses. Based on literature review, a non-potable urban grey water treatment and reuse scheme is proposed and the treatment alternatives for grey water reuse are evaluated according to the grey water characteristics, the proposed standards and economical feasibility."

The use of the drinking water as a vehicle for drugs may be accompanied by several problems. An important condition for a successful medication is a good water solubility of the administered compound. The solubility is influenced by the quality of the used drinking water. The stability of the dissolved drug and incompatibilities with other water ingredients are additional limiting factors. The success of the treatment is influenced also by the taste of the medicated water which may cause a reduced water consumption. The use of tap water instead of spring water may be helpful to improve the efficacy of drug treatment via drinking water."

Therefore, a relatively stable water source from either deeper soil profiles or ground water is necessary for plant growth. Understanding the water use strategy of dominant species in the alpine sandy land ecosystem is important for vegetative rehabilitation and ecological restoration. The stable isotope methodology of \u03b4D, \u03b418O, and \u03b413C was used to determine main water source and long-term water use efficiency of Salix psammophila and S. cheilophila, two dominant shrubs on interdune of alpine sandy land in northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The root systems of two Salix shrubs were investigated to determine their distribution pattern. The results showed that S. psammophila and S. cheilophila absorbed soil water at different soil depths or ground water in different seasons, depending on water availability and water use strategy. Salix psammophila used ground water during the growing season and relied on shallow soil water recharged by rain in summer. Salix cheilophila used ground water in spring and summer, but relied on shallow soil water recharged by rain in spring and deep soil water recharged by ground water in fall. The two shrubs had dimorphic root systems, which is coincident with their water use strategy. Higher biomass of fine roots in S. psammophila and longer fine roots in S. cheilophila facilitated to absorb water in deeper soil layers. The long-term water use efficiency of two Salix shrubs increased during the dry season in spring. The long-term water use efficiency was higher in S. psammophila than in S. cheilophila, as the former species is better adapted to semiarid climate of alpine sandy land. "

The exact derivation of water requirement and more detailed knowledge about the actual water consumption of each animal is only required if water supply is limited or too expensive to be provided in abundance. In case of limited water supply the water requirement is of special interest in order to prevent negative effects on animal health, performance or welfare. Intentions for water restriction or reasons for an accidental reduced water intake are quite different and variable in animal husbandry or keeping of companion animals. The following conditions only represent a few examples: water restriction in order to keep the litter dry (for example in poultry houses), due to technical problems concerning water supply like blocked-up waterers or failure to estimate the water requirement correctly (e.g. pet rabbits fed on concentrate and carrots without any additional water). Water consumption measured under conventional housing conditions (in litre per kg dry matter intake) varies in a wide range (from < 1:1 up to > 4:1) from one species to another. With higher performance leading to increased feed intake, water consumption usually also rises. For this reason it is very useful to calculate water consumption in relation to dry matter intake only. Besides there are several other factors of practical concern that have great influence on water intake: environmental temperature, intake of nutrients, that must be eliminated via the kidneys (e.g. electrolytes, nitrogen), as well as the amount of water spent for certain products like the sweat in horses or cow's milk. The importance of adequate water supply is best understood regarding the consequences of water deprivation (reduced feed intake, concentration of urine, impaired thermoregulation, reduced renal excretion of metabolic waste products, intake of other fluids that may be critical with regard to hygiene, behavioural problems). Because of the consequences of an inadequate water intake for animal welfare--last but not least--legislation on keeping animals provides guidelines for water supply that are controlled (among others) by veterinary administration."

Presently there are no specific legal regulations which define the quality of the drinking water for animals in Germany. However, some rules and criteria exist which help to survey and secure the water supply of animals on farm level. When controlling the hygienic quality of water on the farm it is necessary to investigate not only the water itself but also the local facilities around the water well. If health problems occur in the stock the water tanks, the tubing system which distributes the water in the animal houses and the drinkers have to be checked carefully. Water samples for the analysis on microorganisms and chemical contaminants should be taken according to a strict protocol. The regulations of the German drinking water directive for humans can be used as an orientation to characterise the drinking water quality for the animals. Nevertheless it seems useful to elaborate animal species specific thresholds for water contaminants particularly for food producing animals. A proposal for some threshold values is reported."

The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease."

This study describes the trunk motion and paraspinal muscle activity during the swing of a golfer with related low back pain (LBP) and assesses the effect of a 3-month period of muscle conditioning and coaching on these variables. Motion of the trunk was measured using three-dimensional video analysis and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the same six sites of the erector spinae at the start and end of the 3-month period. At the end of the period, the golfer was able to play and practice without LBP. Coaching resulted in an increase in the range of hip turn and a decrease in the amount of shoulder turn, which occurred during the swing. In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae. These changes may serve to reduce the torsional and compressive loads acting on the thoracic and lumbar spine, which in turn may have contributed to the cessation of the LBP and would reduce the risk of reoccurrence in the future. In conclusion, further research with more subjects would now be warranted in order to test the findings of this program for the prevention of low back in golfers as piloted in this case report."

The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations. As could be expected, genetic differentiation (FST) was significantly correlated with physical distance, but the westernmost population (Ivory Coast) showed values that were intermediate between the central (Gabon) and Eastern (Tanzania) populations. A migration-drift equilibrium in a stable continuum of populations did not appear adequate to describe the observed distribution.

Ten endurance-trained men performed 2 trials, each involving a 10-min warm-up at 60% VO2max followed by a 30-min run. The run was performed on an automated treadmill that allowed the spontaneous selection of speeds without manual input. Participants were asked to run at speeds that equated to a rating of perceived exertion of 15, mouth rinsing with either a 6% CHO or taste-matched placebo (PLA) solution. In addition to recording self-selected speeds and total distance covered the authors assessed the runners' subjective feelings. The total distance covered was greater during the CHO than during the PLA trial (p < .05). Faster speeds selected during the first 5 min of exercise corresponded with enhanced feelings of pleasure when mouth rinsing with the CHO solution. Mouth rinsing with a CHO solution increased total distance covered during a self-selected 30-min run in comparison with mouth rinsing with a color- and taste-matched placebo."

With miniaturized sensor devices, continuous medical monitoring of patients to detect transient life threatening conditions from daily activities has been made possible. This phenomenon will certainly improve the quality of life for a majority of people. However, the growing variety of sensor devices in the market, has made application developments very challenging. In light of this view, we are proposing SLIM, a lightweight middleware that shields the underlying differences in sensor technology from the application layer. SLIM is designed to simplify/accelerate application development while not simply providing common middleware functions (i.e. data acquisition and plug-and-play capability) but also others like security and interactive features. To support both indoor and outdoor activities, SLIM is built to reside on mobile devices. At the end of the paper, we will show the prototype of the proposed middleware including its functionalities when used with a mobile application."

The present study was conducted on a rubber plantation in a hyperendemic area in the rain forest of Liberia, West Africa, where 800 persons were examined. The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease."

The distance covered by the interincisor point and the rotational angle about the transverse axis at maximum mouth opening were larger in men than in women, but the difference cancelled after correcting for mandibular radius in the sagittal plane; mandibular rotation was always larger than translation, but never approaching 100%; opening and closing translations were similar within sex, but their paths were longer in men than in women (P < 0.05); rotational angles around vertical and sagittal axes were negligible; the linear correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was minor and not significant. In normal subjects, mouth opening and closing as modeled at the interincisor point was determined more by mandibular rotation than by translation, but in no occasion a pure rotation was found. The percentage rotation was not identical during mouth opening and closing; female and male paths were not totally coincident; no correlation between maximum mandibular opening and condylar translation was found."

Under baseline conditions maximum flow via the nose was lower than that via the mouth in the upper 50-60% of the VC on expiration and throughout the VC on inspiration. The mean ratio of maximum inspiratory to maximum expiratory flow at mid-VC was 1.38 during mouth breathing and 0.62 during nasal breathing. Inspiratory flow limitation with no increase in flow through the nose as driving pressure was increased above a critical value (usually between 12 and 30 cmH2O) was found in all six subjects studied. Stenting the alae nasi in seven subjects increased peak flow via the nose from a mean of 3.49 to 4.32 l/s on inspiration and from 4.83 to 5.61 l/s on expiration. Topical application of an alpha-adrenergic agonist in seven subjects increased mean peak nasal flow on inspiration from 3.25 to 3.89 l/s and on expiration from 5.03 to 7.09 l/s. Further increases in peak flow occurred with subsequent alan stenting. With the combination of stenting and topical mucosal vasoconstriction, nasal peak flow on expiration reached 81% and, on inspiration, 79% of corresponding peak flows via the mouth. The results demonstrate that narrowing of the alar vestibule and the state of the mucosal vasculature both influence maximum flow through the nose; under optimal conditions, nasal flow capacity is close to that via the mouth."

Classical models of contractile and elastic elements and their underlying assumptions are presented. Mechanical properties of cardiac and skeletal muscle are compared and contrasted and then related to ultrastructure. Information from these approaches leads to the conclusion that the Z band is essential for muscle contraction. Our review of Z band structure shows the Z band at the interface where extracellular components meet the cell surface. The Z band is also the interface from cell surface to myofibril, from extra-myofibrillar to myofibril, and finally from sarcomere to sarcomere. Our studies of Z band in defined physiologic states show that this lattice is an integral part of the contractile elements and can function as an elastic component. The Z band is a complex dynamic lattice uniquely suited to play several roles in muscle contraction."

The valence band is located at the inorganic portion of the molecule while the conduction band is made of carbon-based orbitals. This suggests the great importance of hydrogen bonds where iodine atoms play the role of an acceptor. Weak intermolecular interactions between iodine atoms and aromatic rings are essential in a band structure formation. These materials form orange-red crystals soluble in most of organic solvents.

First, it was verified that overshoot is largely independent of masker duration. Second, overshoot was determined for a variety of 10-ms masker bursts composed of differently filtered uniform masking noise with an overall level of 60 dB SPL: unfiltered, high-pass (cutoff at 3700 Hz), low-pass (cutoff at 5700 Hz), and third-octave-band-(centered at 5000 Hz) filtered uniform masking noises presented separately or combined with different bandpass maskers (5700-16000 Hz, 5700-9500 Hz, 8400-16000 Hz) were used. Third, masked thresholds were measured for maskers composed of an upper or lower octave band adjacent to the third-octave-band masker as a function of the level of the octave band. All maskers containing components above the critical band of the test tone led to overshoot; no additional overshoot was produced by masker components below it. Typical values of overshoot were on the order of 12 dB. Overshoot saturated when masker levels were above 60 dB SPL for the upper octave-band masker. The standard neurophysiological explanation of overshoot accounts only partially for these data. Details that must be accommodated by any full explanation of overshoot are discussed."

There have been, however, no reported detections of the C(0) --> A(0) band in the atmospheres of these or any other planets. We analyzed all available near-infrared limb observations of the dark-side atmosphere of Venus by the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) instrument on the Venus Express spacecraft and found 2 unambiguous detections of this band at equatorial latitudes that seem to be associated with episodic events of highly enhanced nightglow emission. The discovery of the C(0) --> A(0) band means observations in the 1.2-1.3 microm region, which also contains the a(0) --> X(0) emission band of molecular oxygen, can provide a wealth of information on the high-altitude chemistry and dynamics of the Venusian atmosphere."

A total of 2 immunoreactive bands were detected with each primary antibody in infant brain, whereas a single band was present in adult human and rat tissue. Immunoreactivity varied between cortical areas for both receptors, but their regional patterns differed significantly. D(1) protein levels were higher in motor and temporal cortex than in frontal or occipital cortex. D(2) protein showed graded expression frontal > motor > occipital > temporal cortex. Asphyxia cases showed lower expression of the upper D(2) immunoreactive band, but no difference in regional pattern. Lower D(2) receptor expression may attenuate stress responses and underlie increased vulnerability to hypoxia at birth."

Here we describe these cells in adult domestic cats and primates. In cats and rhesus monkeys, DCX+ cells existed across the allo- and neocortex, with an overall ventrodorsal high to low gradient at a given frontal plane. Labeled cells formed a cellular band in layers II and upper III, exhibiting dramatic differences in somal size (5-20 microm), shape (unipolar, bipolar, multipolar and irregular), neuritic complexity and labeling intensity. Cell clusters were also seen in this band, and those in the entorhinal cortex extended into deeper layers as chain-like structures. Densitometry revealed a parallel decline of the cells across regions with age in cats. Besides the cellular band, medium-sized cells with weak DCX reactivity resided sparsely in other layers. Throughout the cortex, virtually all DCX+ cells co-expressed polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule. Medium to large mature-looking DCX+ cells frequently colocalized with neuron-specific nuclear protein and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and those with a reduced DCX expression also partially co-labeled for glutamic acid decarboxylase, parvalbumin, calbindin, beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Similar to cats and monkeys, small and larger DCX+ cells were detected in surgically removed human frontal and temporal cortices. These data suggest that immature neurons persist into adulthood in many cortical areas in cats and primates, and that these cells appear to undergo development and differentiation to become functional subgroups of GABAergic interneurons."

Other than a slight reduction in myofibre diameter and the anaerobic depletion of intermyofibrillar glycogen, no pathological changes were noted in skeletal myofibres after ischaemia. However, after reperfusion there was myofibre enlargement, intermyofibrillar oedema, internalisation of nuclei, myofibrillar and mitochondrial disorganisation and dissolution, and Z-band streaming.

This finding provided a molecular level mechanism for the stark difference in the phase behaviour between the CB and CT insoluble Langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface.

Q(B) accepts electrons from the primary quinone, Q(A), in two sequential electron transfer reactions coupled to uptake of a proton from solution. It has been suggested that water molecules along the proton uptake pathway are protonated upon quinone reduction on the basis of FTIR difference spectra [Breton, J., and Nabedryk, E. (1998) Photosynth. Res. 55, 301-307]. We examined the possible involvement of water molecules in the photoreaction processes by studying (18)O water isotope effects on FTIR difference spectra resulting from formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-). Continuum bands in D(2)O due to Q(B)(-) formation in the 2300-1800 cm(-1) region did not show spectral shifts by (18)O water in the wild-type (WT) RC, suggesting that these bands do not originate from (protonated) water. In contrast, the Q(B)(-)/Q(B) spectrum of the EQ-L212 mutant RC showed a spectral shift of a band near 2100 cm(-1) due to (18)O water substitution, consistent with protonation of internal water. FTIR shifts due to (18)O water were also observed following formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-) in the spectral region of 3700-3500 cm(-1) characteristic of weakly hydrogen bonded water. The water responsible for the Q(B)(-) change was localized near Glu-L212 by spectral shifts in mutant RCs. The weakly hydrogen bonded water perturbed by quinone reduction may play a role in stabilizing the charge-separated state."

By optimizing the nutation angles of the individual pulses, the water and lipid suppression is made insensitive to a range of both T1-relaxation times and B1 inhomogeneities. The method consists only of preparatory RF pulses and thus can be combined with a wide variety of MRSI schemes including both long and short TE studies. Simulations yield suppression factors, in the presence of +/-20% B1 inhomogeneity, on the order of 100 for lipid peaks with three different T1s (300 ms, 310 ms, and 360 ms), and water peaks with T1s ranging from 0.8 s to 4 s.

The absorption, diffuse reflectance, and emission spectra of ice samples containing anisole prepared by different techniques, such as slow freezing (frozen aqueous solutions), shock freezing (ice grains), or anisole vapor deposition on ice grains, were measured to evaluate changes in the contaminated ice matrix that occur at different temperatures. It was found that the position of the lowest absorption band of anisole and its tail shift bathochromically by \u223c4 nm in frozen samples compared to liquid aqueous solutions. On the other hand, the emission spectra of aqueous anisole solutions were found to fundamentally change upon freezing. While one emission band (\u223c290 nm) was observed under all circumstances, the second band at \u223c350 nm, assigned to an anisole excimer, appeared only at certain temperatures (150-250 K). Its disappearance at lower temperatures is attributed to the formation of crystalline anisole on the ice surface. DFT and ADC(2) calculations were used to interpret the absorption and emission spectra of anisole monomer and dimer associates. Various stable arrangements of the anisole associates were found at the disordered water-air interface in the ground and excited states, but only those with a substantial overlap of the aromatic rings are manifested by the emission band at \u223c350 nm.

Coronal sections 25 mum thick were cut through the BF regions and processed every 200 mum for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry. The ALCAR-treated rats had significantly shorter exit times on the Morris maze-water task test than the control rats (ANOVA-enzyme: F(1,39)=112.5, P=0.0001; sessions: F(3,39)=10.41, P=0.0001; interaction: F(3,39)=5.09, P=0.0044).

In the diagonal band of Broca (P<0.0494) and in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus (P<0.0117) there were significantly fewer ChAT-positive neurons in the aged control rats than in the ALCAR-treated rats.

The OD hydroxyl stretches of methanol-OD oligomers in CCl(4) and HOD in H(2)O are studied using the shortest mid-IR pulses (<50 fs, <4 cycles of light) produced to date. The pulses have sufficient spectral bandwidth to span the very broad (>400 cm(-1)) spectrum of the 0-1 and 1-2 transitions. Hydrogen bond population dynamics are extricated with exceptional detail in MeOD oligomers because the different hydrogen bonded species are spectrally distinct. The experimental results along with detailed calculations indicate the strongest hydrogen bonds are selectively broken through a non-equilibrium relaxation pathway following vibrational relaxation of the hydroxyl stretch. The correlation spectra are also a sensitive probe of the fluctuations in water and provide a stringent test of water models that are widely used in simulations of aqueous systems. The analysis of the 2D band shapes demonstrates that different hydrogen bonded species are subject to distinct (wavelength dependent) ultrafast (~100 fs) local fluctuations and essentially identical slow (0.4 and ~2 ps) structural rearrangements. Observation of wavelength dependent dynamics demonstrates that standard theoretical approaches assuming Gaussian fluctuations cannot adequately describe water dynamics."

As compared with mechanical attachments, the dental magnetic attachment has superior characteristics such as easy insertion, good esthetics and less lateral pressure to its abutment tooth. As a result, it has come to be used widely. There are various types of dental magnetic attachments. There are a cup type and a sandwich type in Japan, and several types of dental magnetic attachments in other countries. They are used for a long term in the mouth, it is necessary to clarify those leakage magnetic fields. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate the leakage magnetic fields leaking out of sandwich type and open magnetic circuit type of dental magnetic attachment."

However, the related technology does not seem to be mature because the woven fabric hampers not only the device fabrication process directly on the complex surface but also the transfer printing of ultrathin planar electronic devices. Here we report an indirect method that enables conformal wrapping of surface with arbitrary yet complex shapes. Artificial cilia are introduced in the periphery of electronic devices as adhesive elements. The cilia also play an important role in confining a small amount of glue and damping mechanical stress to maintain robust electronic performance under mechanical deformation. The example of electronic applications depicts the feasibility of cilia for 'stick-&-play' systems, which provide electronic functions by transfer printing on unconventional complex surfaces. "

In the preoperative examination, three-dimentional computed tomography images were essential and very useful for preanesthetic anatomical evaluation of the upper airway, which revealed subglottic narrowing with micrognathia. Considering the anticipated difficulty of the tracheal intubation, and to avoid or minimize the noxious stimuli related to the intubation, we had chosen to use laryngeal mask airway, which provided an appropriate, safe anesthetic respiratory care in this case."

The public health challenge inherent in meeting the MDG targets is ensuring that improvements result in access to water and sanitation for the critical at-risk populations.

The run was performed on an automated treadmill that allowed the spontaneous selection of speeds without manual input. Participants were asked to run at speeds that equated to a rating of perceived exertion of 15, mouth rinsing with either a 6% CHO or taste-matched placebo (PLA) solution. In addition to recording self-selected speeds and total distance covered the authors assessed the runners' subjective feelings. The total distance covered was greater during the CHO than during the PLA trial (p < .05). Faster speeds selected during the first 5 min of exercise corresponded with enhanced feelings of pleasure when mouth rinsing with the CHO solution. Mouth rinsing with a CHO solution increased total distance covered during a self-selected 30-min run in comparison with mouth rinsing with a color- and taste-matched placebo."

In a 10-year period 59 flaps were used in 43 patients to cover defects of the nose, lip and anterior structures of the oral cavity (floor of mouth, tongue, alveolar process). The fate of 26 of the flaps used for reconstruction of defects of the floor of the mouth in 16 patients, were reviewed. All flaps, 6 uni- and 10 bilateral, were inferiorly based. Dehiscence, which occurred twice, and loss of one flap were the main complications. The indications and the technique are discussed. The nasolabial flap is a good alternative for the reconstruction of moderate defects of the floor of the mouth, especially in older patients and even after high doses of preoperative radiotherapy."

These options include prone positioning, the use of a nasal trumpet, and surgery. One surgical technique is the subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth musculature. The theory behind this procedure is that this musculature is under tension, and therefore it pushes the tongue upward and backward, resulting in respiratory obstruction. In theory, the release of this musculature from the mandible should alleviate the tension and hence clear the obstruction. In an attempt to objectively evaluate this theory, we performed subperiosteal release surgery on two infants. Our first patient required an emergent tracheostomy on postoperative day 2 because of the onset of surgically induced airway edema. To avoid this complication in the second patient, we performed a tracheostomy at the same time as surgery. Pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the second patient revealed only a minimal change in the anatomy of the floor of the mouth musculature. We believe the subperiosteal release of the floor of the mouth musculature requires further evaluation before it can be considered to be effective in the surgical treatment of respiratory obstruction in Pierre Robin sequence."

Inductive plethysmography was used to measure the percent of nasal breathing, and the pressure-flow technique was used to estimate nasal area in 15 persons with severe nasal airway impairment. Mean nasal area was 0.17 cm2, and the average percent of nasal breathing was 20%. Analysis revealed a strong correlation (0.87) between nasal size and percent of nasal breathing in this selected group. Modeling studies based on the mean values from the subjects' data indicated that the model \"mouth\" would have to open 0.5 cm2 to shunt 80% of the airflow orally, an amount equivalent to the mean value of the subjects' respiratory mode. More important, the extrapolated data revealed that upper-airway resistance decreased in the model from 8.7 cm H2O/L/sec to a level of 3.2 cm H2O/L/sec, which is an average value for healthy adults. These data support the concept that the mouth acts as a variable resistor to maintain an optimal respiratory tract resistance when the nasal airway is impaired."

By investigating children's performance in detecting these emotions from a specific face region, we were interested to know whether children would show differences in recognizing these expressions from the upper or lower face, and if any difference between specific facial regions depended on the emotion in question. For this purpose, a group of 6-7 year-old children was selected. Participants were asked to recognize emotions by using a labeling task with three stimulus types (region of the eyes, of the mouth, and full face). The findings seem to indicate that children correctly recognize basic facial expressions when pictures represent the whole face, except for a neutral expression, which was recognized from the mouth, and sadness, which was recognized from the eyes. Children are also able to identify anger from the eyes as well as from the whole face. With respect to gender differences, there is no female advantage in emotional recognition. The results indicate a significant interaction 'gender x face region' only for anger and neutral emotions. "

            "article": "Lunge-feeding in rorqual whales represents the largest biomechanical event on Earth and one of the most extreme feeding methods among aquatic vertebrates. By accelerating to high speeds and by opening their mouth to large gape angles, these whales generate the water pressure required to expand their mouth around a large volume of prey-laden water. Such large influx is facilitated by highly extensible ventral groove blubber (VGB) associated with the walls of the throat (buccal cavity). Based on the mechanical properties of this tissue, previous studies have assumed lunge-feeding to be an entirely passive process, where the flow-induced pressure driving the expansion of the VGB is met with little resistance. Such compliant engulfment would be facilitated by the compliant properties of the VGB that have been measured on dead specimens. However, adjoining the ventral blubber are several layers of well-developed muscle embedded with mechanoreceptors, thereby suggesting a capability to gauge the magnitude of engulfed water and use eccentric muscle action to control the flux of water into the mouth. An unsteady hydrodynamic model of fin whale lunge-feeding is presented here to test whether engulfment is exclusively passive and compliant or involves muscle action. The model is based on the explicit simulation of the engulfed water as it interacts with the buccal cavity walls of the whale, under different heuristically motivated cavity forces. Our results, together with their comparison with velocity data collected in the field, suggest that adult rorquals actively push engulfed water forward from the very onset of mouth opening in order to successfully complete a lunge. Interestingly, such an action involves a reflux of the engulfed mass rather than the oft-assumed rebound, which would occur mainly at the very end of a lunge sequence dominated by compliant engulfment. Given the great mass of the engulfed water, reflux creation adds a significant source of hydrodynamic drag to the lunge process, but with the benefit of helping to circumvent the problem of removing prey from baleen by enhancing the efficiency of cross-flow filtration after mouth closing. Reflux management for a successful lunge will therefore demand well-coordinated muscular actions of the tail, mouth and ventral cavity."

The ethanol solution was concurrently available with its water vehicle under fixed-ratio schedules of mouth contacts with a drinking spout in which emission of 8 responses produced a liquid delivery (FR 8). Under these conditions ethanol served as a reinforcer for some subjects--it maintained higher response rates than water--but not for others. In the next experimental condition (Phase 2), subjects were again tested for ethanol self-administration under FR 8 schedules with water concurrently available, but while receiving daily food rations that maintained their body weights at less than what they had been under ad lib feeding conditions. Under these conditions all subjects self-administered ethanol at appreciable levels, but water-maintained responding also was at appreciable levels for some subjects. Increases in ethanol self-administration following institution of the reduced-feeding conditions in Phase 2 generally were inversely related to self-administration levels under the free-feeding conditions of Phase 1 (the greatest proportional increases in ethanol intake occurred with those monkeys that self-administered the least amount of ethanol in Phase 1).

Ten endurance-trained men performed 2 trials, each involving a 10-min warm-up at 60% VO2max followed by a 30-min run. The run was performed on an automated treadmill that allowed the spontaneous selection of speeds without manual input. Participants were asked to run at speeds that equated to a rating of perceived exertion of 15, mouth rinsing with either a 6% CHO or taste-matched placebo (PLA) solution. In addition to recording self-selected speeds and total distance covered the authors assessed the runners' subjective feelings. The total distance covered was greater during the CHO than during the PLA trial (p < .05). Faster speeds selected during the first 5 min of exercise corresponded with enhanced feelings of pleasure when mouth rinsing with the CHO solution. Mouth rinsing with a CHO solution increased total distance covered during a self-selected 30-min run in comparison with mouth rinsing with a color- and taste-matched placebo."

Thirty-five percent of the patients with no clinical evidence of lower GI tract GVHD had symptomatic upper GI GVHD confirmed histologically. Patients with and without upper GI GVHD had no significant difference in their clinical symptoms or in their endoscopic findings. We found an association between upper GI and skin GVHD greater than stage I (P = 0.05), a trend to concordance between upper GI GVHD and clinical GVHD in the lower GI tract (P = 0.08), and with the overall clinical GVHD grade (P = 0.08) but no association with clinical liver involvement.

The observed reflection is modeled using the reflectivity series derived from the salinity and temperature profiles from a nearby Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) location. Sensitivity analysis of temperature and salinity on soundspeed shows that the effect of salinity cannot be ignored for modeling acoustic reflections. The synthetic seismogram matches well with the observed reflection seismic data. Remarkable similarities between the reflection seismic and the salinity profile in the upper thermocline suggest the importance of salinity variations on the water column reflection. Furthermore, impedance inversion of the reflectivity data reveals several thermohaline structures in the water column. The origin of these thermohaline structures is largely unaddressed and may be attributed to the fresh water influx coming from Himalayan and Peninsular rivers or due to the presence of different water masses in the Indian Ocean which warrants a detailed study using concurrent seismic and CTD data.

Renal function and ADH levels were normal in group II. In groups III and IV water diuresis and fractional proximal sodium excretion were significantly decreased, whereas fractional distal sodium resorption and fractional excretion of potassium did not differ from those of controls. Basal ADH was significantly increased only in patients of group IV. In these patients ADH remained abnormally high after water loading. ADH did not correlate with water diuresis, plasma osmolality, mean arterial pressure, and plasma renin activity. We conclude that impaired water excretion in decompensated cirrhotics without hyponatremia cannot be ascribed to high serum levels of ADH. On the contrary, it seems to be related mainly to a reduced delivery of filtrate to the diluting segment of the nephron. In cirrhotic patients with hyponatremia high levels of ADH may play an additional role."

In this work, atomic force microscopy measurements of the surface mechanical properties of isolated plant cutin have been made as a first step to probing the impact of water uptake from the environment on surface flexibility. A dramatic decrease in surface elastic modulus (from approximately 32 to approximately 6 MPa) accompanies increases in water content as small as 2 wt %. Complementary solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements reveal enhanced local mobility of the acyl chain segments with increasing water content, even at molecular sites remote from the covalent cross-links that are likely to play a crucial role in cutin's elastic properties."

Q(B) accepts electrons from the primary quinone, Q(A), in two sequential electron transfer reactions coupled to uptake of a proton from solution. It has been suggested that water molecules along the proton uptake pathway are protonated upon quinone reduction on the basis of FTIR difference spectra [Breton, J., and Nabedryk, E. (1998) Photosynth. Res. 55, 301-307]. We examined the possible involvement of water molecules in the photoreaction processes by studying (18)O water isotope effects on FTIR difference spectra resulting from formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-). Continuum bands in D(2)O due to Q(B)(-) formation in the 2300-1800 cm(-1) region did not show spectral shifts by (18)O water in the wild-type (WT) RC, suggesting that these bands do not originate from (protonated) water. In contrast, the Q(B)(-)/Q(B) spectrum of the EQ-L212 mutant RC showed a spectral shift of a band near 2100 cm(-1) due to (18)O water substitution, consistent with protonation of internal water. FTIR shifts due to (18)O water were also observed following formation of Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-) in the spectral region of 3700-3500 cm(-1) characteristic of weakly hydrogen bonded water. The water responsible for the Q(B)(-) change was localized near Glu-L212 by spectral shifts in mutant RCs. The weakly hydrogen bonded water perturbed by quinone reduction may play a role in stabilizing the charge-separated state."

In this article, we describe a series of studies made by applying stable isotope tracers to the study of surfactant metabolism and lung water. In a first set of studies, which we call 'endogenous studies', using stable isotope-labelled intravenous surfactant precursors, we showed the feasibility of measuring surfactant synthesis and kinetics in infants using several metabolic precursors including plasma glucose, plasma fatty acids and body water. In a second set of studies, named 'exogenous studies', using stable isotope-labelled phosphatidylcholine tracer given endotracheally, we could estimate surfactant disaturated phosphatidylcholine pool size and half-life. Very recent studies are focusing on lung water and on the endogenous biosynthesis of the surfactant-specific proteins. Information obtained from these studies in infants will help to better tailor exogenous surfactant treatment in neonatal lung diseases."

In this paper we quantify these downstream effects by applying the empirical U.S. Geological Survey water-quality model SPARROW to investigate whether spatial differences in conservation intensity were statistically correlated with variations in nutrient loads. In contrast to other forms of water quality data analysis, the application of SPARROW controls for confounding factors such as hydrologic variability, multiple sources and environmental processes. A measure of conservation intensity was derived from the USDA-CEAP regional assessment of the Upper Mississippi River and used as an explanatory variable in a model of the Upper Midwest. The spatial pattern of conservation intensity was negatively correlated (p = 0.003) with the total nitrogen loads in streams in the basin. Total phosphorus loads were weakly negatively correlated with conservation (p = 0.25). Regional nitrogen reductions were estimated to range from 5 to 34% and phosphorus reductions from 1 to 10% in major river basins of the Upper Mississippi region. The statistical associations between conservation and nutrient loads are consistent with hydrological and biogeochemical processes such as denitrification. The results provide empirical evidence at the regional scale that conservation practices have had a larger statistically detectable effect on nitrogen than on phosphorus loadings in streams and rivers of the Upper Mississippi Basin.

France), one with a podzol, the other with an acid brown soil, were monitored by analysing soil solutions and two related springs for total chemistry and Al speciation. High concentrations of inorganic Al did not occur in the podzol upper horizons but were evident in the corresponding spring, together with low concentrations of Ca. In the acid brown soil area, high concentrations of inorganic Al occurred in the leaching water draining the upper soil horizons, but not in the undrained water nor in the spring, the latter exhibiting rather high Ca content. In both watersheds, needle yellowing in conifers could be observed and might be ascribed to Mg deficiency rather than to Al toxicity."

Combinations of different grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose were prepared as 2% or 3.3% solutions to yield input viscosities of low (approximately 5000 cp at 37 degrees C and 1 s-1), medium (15,000 cp), or high (30,000 cp) viscosity. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose modified intralumenal viscosity, with a linear relationship existing between input and lumenal viscosity. With regard to transit, the lag time before the onset of chyme recovery increased linearly as a function of luminal viscosity. There was also a pronounced decrease in the first-order emptying rate constant as lumenal viscosity increased from water to low-viscosity hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, but as viscosity was further increased there was little additional change. These results indicate that water-soluble fibers can exert a significant influence on both the lumenal viscosity and the transit profile in the upper gastrointestinal tract."

Almost everywhere the water entering water-conduit wells from deep slits (100-180 m) contains averagely 2-3 times higher tritium concentrations than the water from less deep personal wells, slits and springs. Tritium levels in the drinking water supply decrease with the distance from the dam; while in wells, springs and personal wells they are constant all along the river. The observed phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the river bed of the Techa is situated at a break zone of the earth crust, where the contaminated deep water penetrates from the reservoirs of the \"Mayak\" enterprise situated in the upper part of the regulated river bed. Less deep water sources (personal wells, slits and springs) receive predominantly flood, atmospheric and subsoil waters and are not connected with the reservoirs."

However, recently these concepts were introduced in turnover models acting on the production or loss of response, respectively, even for simple (nontolerant) systems. In the latter case, the physiological limit kicks in when the state variable (response) approaches either a lower or an upper limit, not before. In this paper we propose a new approach with either one (lower or upper) limit or two (simultaneously acting lower and upper) limits (dual limits). We present an analytical mathematical treatment as well as a numerical treatment via model simulations. This approach allows for a baseline value to be only weakly dependent on the lower/upper physiological limit. It also allows dual limits, one below and one above, which is attractive because it may be applicable to commonly studied physiological and biochemical systems such as turnover of water or fat."

However, the authors present a case study of seismic data from Krishna-Godavari Basin which shows that salinity variations also play an important role in the occurrence of water column reflections. The observed reflection is modeled using the reflectivity series derived from the salinity and temperature profiles from a nearby Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) location. Sensitivity analysis of temperature and salinity on soundspeed shows that the effect of salinity cannot be ignored for modeling acoustic reflections. The synthetic seismogram matches well with the observed reflection seismic data. Remarkable similarities between the reflection seismic and the salinity profile in the upper thermocline suggest the importance of salinity variations on the water column reflection. Furthermore, impedance inversion of the reflectivity data reveals several thermohaline structures in the water column. The origin of these thermohaline structures is largely unaddressed and may be attributed to the fresh water influx coming from Himalayan and Peninsular rivers or due to the presence of different water masses in the Indian Ocean which warrants a detailed study using concurrent seismic and CTD data.

We show that the selectivity is dependent, in part, on the solvation in the cavity (sometimes referred to as the vestibule, it is the region containing water molecules between the intracellular gate and the selectivity filter at the extracellular end of the pore). We have shown earlier that potassium is more dependent at the upper end of the cavity region on solvation by the threonines there, while sodium ion has more water molecules as ligands. In addition, sodium ion is placed asymmetrically, while potassium is nearly exactly symmetric with respect to the four-fold symmetry of the channel. We have now extended these calculations to rubidium and cesium ions, and find that rubidium solvation resembles that of potassium (and both are permeant ions), while cesium resembles sodium (and both are non-permeant), in terms of the geometry of up to eight hydrating, and four non-hydrating, water molecules. In each case, a maximum of 12 water molecules are relevant to the calculation. The placement of the water molecules in the two cases is essentially the same as found from the electron density in the X-ray structure of Zhou and MacKinnon. For Na(+) and K(+), we show that energy decreases from bulk to the cavity to the lowest position in the selectivity filter (accurate energy could not be calculated for the heavier ions). A separate calculation shows that fixing the Na(+) ion at the position of the K(+) minimum, followed by re-optimization produced a significantly modified system, not something that could be produced by thermal fluctuations. Moving the K(+) into the Na(+) position in the upper cavity led to a small increase in energy, approximately 3 k(B)T, but was accompanied by large shifts in the positions of hydrating waters, which would create a major kinetic barrier. Therefore, thermal fluctuations could not invalidate the conclusions of the main calculations."

Calcareous dinoflagellate cysts appear to be widely distributed throughout the studied area. In the surface sediments, concentrations (cyst per gram dry sediment) of the vegetative stage Thoracosphaera heimii are generally higher than that of the (presumably) calcareous resting cysts.

Rhabdothorax spp. is characteristically present in sediments of more temperate regions characterized by high seasonality. Dinoflagellates producing these cysts are able to tolerate high nutrient concentrations, and mixing of the water column. S. albatrosiana is abundant in regions characterized by high sea surface temperatures and oligotrophic surface water conditions. In contrast, the distribution of S. tuberosa var. 2 is negatively related to temperature. The other cyst species did not show a characteristic pattern in relation to the studied environmental gradients.The ratio of Sphaerodinella tuberosa var. 2 to Orthopithonella granifera can be used for reconstructing the presence of stratification in the upper 50m of the water column, whereas the ratios of S. tuberosa var. 2 to Sphaerodinella albatrosiana and of O. granifera to Rhabdothorax spp. might be used for palaeotemperature reconstructions. Calcareous dinoflagellate cysts are abundant in oligotrophic areas and may be useful for the reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions."

The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations.

Therefore, a relatively stable water source from either deeper soil profiles or ground water is necessary for plant growth. Understanding the water use strategy of dominant species in the alpine sandy land ecosystem is important for vegetative rehabilitation and ecological restoration. The stable isotope methodology of \u03b4D, \u03b418O, and \u03b413C was used to determine main water source and long-term water use efficiency of Salix psammophila and S. cheilophila, two dominant shrubs on interdune of alpine sandy land in northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The root systems of two Salix shrubs were investigated to determine their distribution pattern. The results showed that S. psammophila and S. cheilophila absorbed soil water at different soil depths or ground water in different seasons, depending on water availability and water use strategy. Salix psammophila used ground water during the growing season and relied on shallow soil water recharged by rain in summer. Salix cheilophila used ground water in spring and summer, but relied on shallow soil water recharged by rain in spring and deep soil water recharged by ground water in fall. The two shrubs had dimorphic root systems, which is coincident with their water use strategy. Higher biomass of fine roots in S. psammophila and longer fine roots in S. cheilophila facilitated to absorb water in deeper soil layers. The long-term water use efficiency of two Salix shrubs increased during the dry season in spring. The long-term water use efficiency was higher in S. psammophila than in S. cheilophila, as the former species is better adapted to semiarid climate of alpine sandy land. "

There were significant differences among the towns in the proportion of the samples contaminated with coliforms (P < 0.001) and E. coli (P < 0.001). Of 253 strains of E. coli studied, 4 (1.6%) were mucoid, 9 (3.6%) were hemolytic, and 37 (14.6%) were nonsorbitol fermenters. Of 69 isolates of E. coli tested, 10 (14.5%) were verocytotoxigenic. Twenty-eight (14.0%) of 200 E. coli isolates tested belonged to enteropathogenic serogroups. Standpipe, the most common water source, was utilized by 57 (34.1%) of the 167 households. Treated water (pipeborne in homes, standpipes, or truckborne) was supplied to 119 households (71.3%), while 48 households (28.7%) used water from untreated sources (rain, river/stream, or well) as their primary water supply. The type of household storage device was associated with coliform contamination. Water stored in drums, barrels, or buckets was more likely to harbor fecal coliforms (74.2% of samples) than was water stored in tanks (53.3% of samples), even after controlling for water source (P = 0.04). Compared with water from other sources, water piped into homes was significantly less likely to be contaminated with total coliforms (56.9% versus 88.8%, P < 0.001) and fecal coliforms (41.2% versus 69.8%, P < 0.01), even when the type of storage device was taken into account. However, fecal contamination was not associated with whether the water came from a treated or untreated source.

In recent years, rainwater harvesting has become one of the primary sustainable water management techniques to counteract the growing demand for potable water. This paper presents the outcomes of an in-depth research study into particulate matter build-up and wash-off for roof surfaces. In this research, particulate matter was considered as the indicator pollutant where the processes related to other pollutants can be predicted based on the understanding generated for particulate matter. The study outcomes confirm that the build-up process on roof surfaces is comparatively similar to road surfaces. However, particle loads collected from roofs were significantly less compared to road surfaces and much finer in texture. Wash-off from roofs also showed significant similarities to wash-off from roads. A relatively high concentration of particulate matter was noted during the initial part of storm events. Furthermore, the amount of particulate matter remaining on the roof surfaces was significantly high for less intense rain events."

In this study, we examined the expression of Cav-1 in 34 human PDAC tissue samples and the associated peritumoral tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001). Based on the results of this study, the inclusion of Cav-1 in a putative panel of biomarkers predicting pancreatic cancer aggressiveness is warranted."

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC. Further, ventral LOC voxels were found to be broadly tuned and represent all aspects of stimulus similarity, whereas lateral LOC voxels were narrowly tuned and preferentially represented the shape of small features rather than their orientation within the shape.

It was demonstrated that overexpression of GhGA20ox1 enhanced preferentially the GA(4+7) biosynthesis in N. benthamiana and conferred GA-overproduction characters to transformants. The extent of phenotypic alteration in the transgenic plants was found to correlate with the transcriptional levels of GhGA20ox1 and GA contents. Results indicated that the GhGA20ox1 gene promoted the biosynthesis of the active GAs (GA(4+7)) in transgenic tobacco plants therefore represents a useful gene for manipulating GA levels."

Ninety-two magnetocardiograms of singletons with normal courses of pregnancy between 24 + 1 and 41 + 6 wks GA were studied. Heart rate patterns were either quiet/non-accelerative (fHRP I) or active/accelerative (fHRP II) and recording quality sufficient for fHRV. The sample was divided into the GA groups <32 wks GA/>32 wks GA. Linear parameters of fHRV were calculated: mean heart rate (mHR), SDNN and RMSSD of normal-to-normal interbeat intervals, power in the low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency range (0.15-0.4 Hz) and the ratios SDNN/RMSSD and LF/HF as markers for sympatho-vagal balance. fHRP I is characterized by decreasing SDNN/RMSSD, LF/HF and mHR. The decrease is more pronounced <32 wks GA. Beyond that GA SDNN/RMSSD is predominantly determined by RMSSD during fHRP I and by SDNN during fHRP II. In contrast to fHRP I, during fHRP II, mHR is positively correlated to SDNN/RMSSD instead of SDNN >32 wks GA. LF/HF increases in fHRP II during the first half of the third trimester. Non-accelerative fHRP are indicative of parasympathetic dominance >32 wks GA. In contrast, the sympathetic accentuation during accelerative fHRP is displayed in the interrelations between mHR, SDNN and SDNN/RMSSD. Prior to 32 wks GA, fHRV reveals the increasing activity of the respective branches of the autonomic nervous system differentiating the types of fHRP."

The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations. As could be expected, genetic differentiation (FST) was significantly correlated with physical distance, but the westernmost population (Ivory Coast) showed values that were intermediate between the central (Gabon) and Eastern (Tanzania) populations. A migration-drift equilibrium in a stable continuum of populations did not appear adequate to describe the observed distribution.

This study describes the trunk motion and paraspinal muscle activity during the swing of a golfer with related low back pain (LBP) and assesses the effect of a 3-month period of muscle conditioning and coaching on these variables. Motion of the trunk was measured using three-dimensional video analysis and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the same six sites of the erector spinae at the start and end of the 3-month period. At the end of the period, the golfer was able to play and practice without LBP. Coaching resulted in an increase in the range of hip turn and a decrease in the amount of shoulder turn, which occurred during the swing. In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae. These changes may serve to reduce the torsional and compressive loads acting on the thoracic and lumbar spine, which in turn may have contributed to the cessation of the LBP and would reduce the risk of reoccurrence in the future. In conclusion, further research with more subjects would now be warranted in order to test the findings of this program for the prevention of low back in golfers as piloted in this case report."

Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001).

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

New studies on many different viruses have shown that virus attachment and cell entry is often a multistep process, requiring many interactions between the virus and cell surface molecules. In this study, we have attempted to identify the cell surface molecules involved in Coxsackievirus A9 (CAV-9), a common human pathogen and a member of the Picornavirus family, infectious process. GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical. The role of MAP-70 in CAV-9 infectious process is discussed."

Five noncontiguous rain forest sites (from Tanzania, Gabon and Ivory Coast) were sampled to measure the effects of historical forest fragmentation on population structure in an obligatory forest-dwelling species. The Ivory Coast and Gabon populations showed a wider range of alleles, different modal alleles and had a higher genetic diversity than the three East African populations. As could be expected, genetic differentiation (FST) was significantly correlated with physical distance, but the westernmost population (Ivory Coast) showed values that were intermediate between the central (Gabon) and Eastern (Tanzania) populations. A migration-drift equilibrium in a stable continuum of populations did not appear adequate to describe the observed distribution. It seems probable that the species has undergone abrupt changes involving isolation, merging and migration of populations, as a consequence of repeated waves of forest fragmentation and coalescence."

The third group served as unvaccinated controls. All vaccinated dogs subsequently developed serum antibody titers to Bb that persisted for at least 1 year. Following Bb challenge 1 year after vaccination, all vaccinated dogs, regardless of group, showed significantly fewer clinical signs and shed significantly fewer challenge organisms than unvaccinated controls.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that IBV contained in chicken lachrymal fluid is infectious and that tears of IBV-infected chickens can be used to infect naive chickens. We compared the immune responses to IBV in the Harderian gland and cecal tonsils of immunocompetent chickens and chickens infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocytes in Harderian glands and cecal tonsils indicated that the relative abundance of IgM+ B cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils following exposure to IBV in combination with immunosuppressive viruses was reduced compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. CAV, but not IBDV, reduced the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. Enzyme-linked immuno-spot forming assays on cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils of IBV-infected chickens indicated that maximum IBV-specific IgA-secreting cell responses were reduced in chickens infected with CAV. IBDV co-infected chickens displayed a delayed IgA response to IBV. Thus immunosuppressive viruses reduced B cells and T helper cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils in response to IBV, and slowed the kinetics and/or reduced the magnitude of the mucosal immune response against IBV. We have shown for the first time that CAV affects pathogen-specific B cell responses in a mucosal effector site."

In ventral but not lateral LOC, a linear recovery from adaptation proportional to shape dissimilarity was seen. In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC. Further, ventral LOC voxels were found to be broadly tuned and represent all aspects of stimulus similarity, whereas lateral LOC voxels were narrowly tuned and preferentially represented the shape of small features rather than their orientation within the shape. The results, indicating a coarse spatial coding of shape features in lateral LOC and a more focused coding of the entire shape space within ventral LOC, may be related to hierarchical models of object processing."

The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease."

Heart rate patterns were either quiet/non-accelerative (fHRP I) or active/accelerative (fHRP II) and recording quality sufficient for fHRV. The sample was divided into the GA groups <32 wks GA/>32 wks GA. Linear parameters of fHRV were calculated: mean heart rate (mHR), SDNN and RMSSD of normal-to-normal interbeat intervals, power in the low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency range (0.15-0.4 Hz) and the ratios SDNN/RMSSD and LF/HF as markers for sympatho-vagal balance. fHRP I is characterized by decreasing SDNN/RMSSD, LF/HF and mHR. The decrease is more pronounced <32 wks GA. Beyond that GA SDNN/RMSSD is predominantly determined by RMSSD during fHRP I and by SDNN during fHRP II. In contrast to fHRP I, during fHRP II, mHR is positively correlated to SDNN/RMSSD instead of SDNN >32 wks GA. LF/HF increases in fHRP II during the first half of the third trimester. Non-accelerative fHRP are indicative of parasympathetic dominance >32 wks GA. In contrast, the sympathetic accentuation during accelerative fHRP is displayed in the interrelations between mHR, SDNN and SDNN/RMSSD. Prior to 32 wks GA, fHRV reveals the increasing activity of the respective branches of the autonomic nervous system differentiating the types of fHRP."

Existing forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (about 10 kg P ha(-1)). Mean runoff volume from bare ground was generally twice that observed from low, medium, and high levels of cover, which were similar. For all rainfall events combined, export of dissolved reactive P was greatest (P < 0.1) at bare ground and was reduced 31% at low cover, which did not differ from medium or high cover. Mean total Kjeldahl P export was greater (P < 0.001) from bare ground than from other cover levels. Results indicate that riparian bare areas can contribute substantial sediment (>215 kg ha(-1)) and P (0.7 kg P ha(-1)) to surface waters during heavy rainfall, whereas export may be reduced equally well by low cover (45%) as by high cover."

Tree cover typically retained in agricultural landscapes in the neotropics may provide resources and habitats for animals, but little is known about the extent to which it contributes to conservation of animal species. Here, we explore the animal diversity associated with different forms of tree cover for birds, bats, butterflies, and dung beetles in a pastoral landscape in Nicaragua. We measured species richness and abundance of these four animal taxa in riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, live fences, and pastures with high and low tree cover. We recorded over 20,000 individuals of 189 species including 14 endangered bird species. Mean abundance and species richness of birds and bats, but not dung beetles or butterflies, were significantly different among forms of tree cover. Species richness of bats and birds was positively correlated with tree species richness. While the greatest numbers of bird species were associated with riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, and pastures with >15% tree cover, the greatest numbers of bat species were found in live fences and riparian forest. Species assemblages of all animal taxa were different among tree cover types, so that maintaining a diversity of forms of tree cover led to conservation of more animal species in the landscape as a whole. Overall, the findings indicate that retaining tree cover within agricultural landscapes can help conserve animal diversity, but that conservation efforts need to target forms of tree cover that conserve the taxa that are of interest locally. Preventing the degradation of remaining forest fragments is a priority, but encouraging farmers to maintain tree cover in pastures and along boundaries may also make an important contribution to animal conservation."

This study describes the trunk motion and paraspinal muscle activity during the swing of a golfer with related low back pain (LBP) and assesses the effect of a 3-month period of muscle conditioning and coaching on these variables. Motion of the trunk was measured using three-dimensional video analysis and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the same six sites of the erector spinae at the start and end of the 3-month period. At the end of the period, the golfer was able to play and practice without LBP. Coaching resulted in an increase in the range of hip turn and a decrease in the amount of shoulder turn, which occurred during the swing. In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae. These changes may serve to reduce the torsional and compressive loads acting on the thoracic and lumbar spine, which in turn may have contributed to the cessation of the LBP and would reduce the risk of reoccurrence in the future. In conclusion, further research with more subjects would now be warranted in order to test the findings of this program for the prevention of low back in golfers as piloted in this case report."

In this study, we examined the expression of Cav-1 in 34 human PDAC tissue samples and the associated peritumoral tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001).

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

We compared the immune responses to IBV in the Harderian gland and cecal tonsils of immunocompetent chickens and chickens infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocytes in Harderian glands and cecal tonsils indicated that the relative abundance of IgM+ B cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils following exposure to IBV in combination with immunosuppressive viruses was reduced compared to chickens infected with IBV alone. CAV, but not IBDV, reduced the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios compared to chickens infected with IBV alone.

IBDV co-infected chickens displayed a delayed IgA response to IBV. Thus immunosuppressive viruses reduced B cells and T helper cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils in response to IBV, and slowed the kinetics and/or reduced the magnitude of the mucosal immune response against IBV.

In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC.

Over the years, substantial progress has been made in understanding the regulation of GA signalling and metabolism, which ensures appropriate levels of GAs for growth and development(2). Moreover, an additional level of regulation may reside in the transport of GAs from production sites to recipient tissues that require GAs for growth. Although there is considerable evidence suggesting the existence of short- and long-distance movement of GAs in plants(3-8), the nature and the biological properties of this transport are not yet understood. Here, we combine biochemical and conventional micrografting experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana to show that the GA precursor GA12, although biologically inactive by itself, is the major mobile GA signal over long distances. Quantitative analysis of endogenous GAs in xylem and phloem exudates further indicates that GA12 moves through the plant vascular system. Finally, we demonstrate that GA12 is functional in recipient tissues, supporting growth via the activation of the GA signalling cascade. Collectively, these results reveal the existence of long-range transport of endogenous GA12 in plants that may have implications for the control of developmental phase transitions and the adaptation to adverse environments.

The kinetics of lipid translocation were determined by an analysis of the SFVS intensity versus time at different temperatures in the presence of 2 mol % gA. The rate constants of DSPC flip-flop increase from 2 to 10 times relative to the pure DSPC system. The results indicate that facial lipid exchange can be induced by a hydrophobic transmembrane helix.

(1999) J. Neurochem. 72, 2362]. In order to study these reactions in relation to the stage of cell differentiation, we examined generation of HDL by rat astrocytoma cells. Lack of apoE secretion was found in three astrocytoma cell lines, human T98G, rat C6, and GA-1 [Kano-Tanaka et al. (1986) Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B 62, 109]. GA-1 produced apoE at very low level and therefore generated much less HDL by itself than the astrocytes in primary culture. In contrast, GA-1 interacted with exogenous apoE and apoA-I to produce cholesterol-rich HDL while the astrocytes produced cholesterol-poor HDL with these apolipoproteins. Cholesterol biosynthesis rate measured from mevalonate was higher and down-regulated more by LDL in the astrocytes than GA-1. On the other hand, the cellular cholesterol level, uptake of LDL, and cyclodextrin-mediated non-specific diffusion of cholesterol from cell surface were same between these two cells. Treatment of GA-1 with acidic fibroblast growth factor influenced neither the production of apoE nor the baseline lipid secretion, but increased the cholesterol synthesis from mevalonate and the magnitude of its down-regulation by LDL, and decreased cholesterol content in the HDL produced by exogenous apoA-I. In conclusion, suppression of apoE biosynthesis in the undifferentiated astrocytes GA-1 resulted in poor secretion of cholesterol-rich HDL and in turn more production of HDL with exogenous apolipoprotein. Cellular cholesterol homeostasis was altered accordingly."

Inspired by the joint architectures in the human body, where small amounts of soft cartilage connect stiff (or hard) but hollow (and thus lightweight) bones, the 3D internetworked GA@PDMS achieves synergistic toughening. The resulting GA@PDMS nanocomposites exhibit fully reversible structural deformations (99.8% recovery even at a 90% compressive strain) and high compressive mechanical strength (448.2 kPa at a compressive strain of 90%) at repeated compression cycles. Owing to the combination of excellent mechanical and electrical properties, the GA@PDMS nanocomposites are used as signal transducers for strain sensors, showing very short response and recovery times (in the millisecond range) with reliable sensitivity and extreme durability. Furthermore, the proposed system is applied to electronic scales with a large detectable weight of about 4600 times greater than its own weight. Such bio-inspired cartilage architecture opens the door to fabricate new 3D multifunctional and mechanically durable nanocomposites for emerging applications, which include sensors, actuators, and flexible devices.

In contrast to fHRP I, during fHRP II, mHR is positively correlated to SDNN/RMSSD instead of SDNN >32 wks GA. LF/HF increases in fHRP II during the first half of the third trimester. Non-accelerative fHRP are indicative of parasympathetic dominance >32 wks GA. In contrast, the sympathetic accentuation during accelerative fHRP is displayed in the interrelations between mHR, SDNN and SDNN/RMSSD. Prior to 32 wks GA, fHRV reveals the increasing activity of the respective branches of the autonomic nervous system differentiating the types of fHRP."

In this study, we examined the expression of Cav-1 in 34 human PDAC tissue samples and the associated peritumoral tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001).

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical.

In contrast, a strong correspondence of the distributed neural pattern and stimulus similarity was observed in lateral LOC but not ventral LOC. Further, ventral LOC voxels were found to be broadly tuned and represent all aspects of stimulus similarity, whereas lateral LOC voxels were narrowly tuned and preferentially represented the shape of small features rather than their orientation within the shape.

One of the most widely employed strategies for assessing social skill has been role-play tests: simulated social interactions that are videotaped for subsequent behavioral coding. There has been considerable discussion of the validity of the approach in the literature, but there has not been adequate consideration of other psychometric characteristics of role-play tests. This paper examines the psychometric characteristics of a representative role-play measure: the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC). Data from 5 large schizophrenia studies that included the MASC were examined: a study of victimization in women who abuse drugs, a study of health care among people with diabetes, a study of vocational outcomes, a study of social skill among drug abusers, and a clinical trial comparing two antipsychotic medications. Data were examined in terms of five questions: (1) Can role-play scenes be rated reliably? (2) How are role-play ratings distributed across populations? (3) How many and which behaviors should be rated? (4) How many role-play scenes are required? (5) Is role-play behavior temporally stable? Overall, the data suggest that the MASC, and by implication other similar role-play procedures, does have good psychometric properties. However, several things often taken for granted in the literature warrant careful consideration in the design of research using role-play. Implications of the results for design of research are discussed."

This study describes the trunk motion and paraspinal muscle activity during the swing of a golfer with related low back pain (LBP) and assesses the effect of a 3-month period of muscle conditioning and coaching on these variables. Motion of the trunk was measured using three-dimensional video analysis and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the same six sites of the erector spinae at the start and end of the 3-month period. At the end of the period, the golfer was able to play and practice without LBP. Coaching resulted in an increase in the range of hip turn and a decrease in the amount of shoulder turn, which occurred during the swing. In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae. These changes may serve to reduce the torsional and compressive loads acting on the thoracic and lumbar spine, which in turn may have contributed to the cessation of the LBP and would reduce the risk of reoccurrence in the future. In conclusion, further research with more subjects would now be warranted in order to test the findings of this program for the prevention of low back in golfers as piloted in this case report."

One of the most widely employed strategies for assessing social skill has been role-play tests: simulated social interactions that are videotaped for subsequent behavioral coding. There has been considerable discussion of the validity of the approach in the literature, but there has not been adequate consideration of other psychometric characteristics of role-play tests. This paper examines the psychometric characteristics of a representative role-play measure: the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC). Data from 5 large schizophrenia studies that included the MASC were examined: a study of victimization in women who abuse drugs, a study of health care among people with diabetes, a study of vocational outcomes, a study of social skill among drug abusers, and a clinical trial comparing two antipsychotic medications. Data were examined in terms of five questions: (1) Can role-play scenes be rated reliably? (2) How are role-play ratings distributed across populations? (3) How many and which behaviors should be rated? (4) How many role-play scenes are required? (5) Is role-play behavior temporally stable? Overall, the data suggest that the MASC, and by implication other similar role-play procedures, does have good psychometric properties. However, several things often taken for granted in the literature warrant careful consideration in the design of research using role-play. Implications of the results for design of research are discussed."

Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue.

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

Further, ventral LOC voxels were found to be broadly tuned and represent all aspects of stimulus similarity, whereas lateral LOC voxels were narrowly tuned and preferentially represented the shape of small features rather than their orientation within the shape.

This study describes the trunk motion and paraspinal muscle activity during the swing of a golfer with related low back pain (LBP) and assesses the effect of a 3-month period of muscle conditioning and coaching on these variables. Motion of the trunk was measured using three-dimensional video analysis and electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the same six sites of the erector spinae at the start and end of the 3-month period. At the end of the period, the golfer was able to play and practice without LBP. Coaching resulted in an increase in the range of hip turn and a decrease in the amount of shoulder turn, which occurred during the swing. In addition, a reduction in the amount of trunk flexion/lateral flexion during the downswing occurred in conjunction with less activity in the left erector spinae. These changes may serve to reduce the torsional and compressive loads acting on the thoracic and lumbar spine, which in turn may have contributed to the cessation of the LBP and would reduce the risk of reoccurrence in the future. In conclusion, further research with more subjects would now be warranted in order to test the findings of this program for the prevention of low back in golfers as piloted in this case report."

Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005).

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

We compared the immune responses to IBV in the Harderian gland and cecal tonsils of immunocompetent chickens and chickens infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocytes in Harderian glands and cecal tonsils indicated that the relative abundance of IgM+ B cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils following exposure to IBV in combination with immunosuppressive viruses was reduced compared to chickens infected with IBV alone.

Our proposed system monitors feet motion and pressure distribution beneath the feet in real-time and classifies the state of the patient.

Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001).

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

Their functions remain unclear although they are known to be involved in specific events in cell signaling and endocytosis. Caenorhabditis elegans encodes two caveolin genes, cav-1 and cav-2. We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies. Using the styryl dye FM4-64 and BODIPY-labeled lactosylceramide, we show that the intestinal cells of cav-2 animals are defective in the apical uptake of lipid markers. These results suggest parallels with the function of caveolins in lipid homeostasis in mammals. We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants. Analysis of fluorescent markers of basolateral endocytosis and recycling suggest that endocytosis is normal in cav-2 mutants and thus, that the suppression of basolateral recycling defects in cav-2 mutants is due to changes in intracellular trafficking pathways. Finally, cav-2 mutants also have abnormal trafficking of yolk proteins. Taken together, these data indicate that caveolin-2 is an integral component of the trafficking network in the intestinal cells of C. elegans."

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3(-/-)-null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3(-/-) virgin mammary glands developed lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3(-/-) mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3(-/-) mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3(-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers."

Moreover, caveolin-1 protein levels were significantly reduced in human tumor epithelial mucosa (3.6 +/- 1.4-fold) when compared with normal colon mucosa for a majority (10 of 15) of the patients characterized. To directly assess the role of caveolin-1 in tumor development, caveolin-1 was reexpressed in the HT29 and DLD1 colon carcinoma cells, and the resulting HT29-cav-1 or DLD1-cav-1 cells were tested for tumorigenicity in nude mice. In most experiments, tumor formation was either blocked or retarded for HT29-cav-1 cells (10 of 13 mice) and DLD1-cav-1 cells (5 of 7 mice), as compared with both mock-transfected and parental HT29 or DLD1 cells. Interestingly, basal caveolin-1 levels were significantly reduced in HT29-cav-1 and DLD1-cav-1 cells isolated from tumors. Likewise, endogenous caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels were found to be reduced in NIH-3T3 cells recovered from tumors after injection into nude mice. Thus, reexpression of caveolin-1 in colon carcinoma lines reduced the probability of tumor formation in vivo, and when tumors did develop from either HT29-cav-1, DLD1-cav-1, or NIH-3T3 cells, lower basal levels of caveolin-1 were detected. Finally, evidence was obtained indicating that initial caveolin-1 down-regulation in colon cancer cells need not be an entirely irreversible process because cell survival on selection for either drug resistance or increased metastatic potential correlated with increased caveolin-1 expression levels."

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads.

The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical.

We compared the immune responses to IBV in the Harderian gland and cecal tonsils of immunocompetent chickens and chickens infected with chicken anemia virus (CAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Flow cytometry analyses of lymphocytes in Harderian glands and cecal tonsils indicated that the relative abundance of IgM+ B cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils following exposure to IBV in combination with immunosuppressive viruses was reduced compared to chickens infected with IBV alone.

IBDV co-infected chickens displayed a delayed IgA response to IBV. Thus immunosuppressive viruses reduced B cells and T helper cells in the Harderian glands and cecal tonsils in response to IBV, and slowed the kinetics and/or reduced the magnitude of the mucosal immune response against IBV.

In this study, we examined the expression of Cav-1 in 34 human PDAC tissue samples and the associated peritumoral tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Additionally, we correlated Cav-1 expression with other tissue (Ki-67, p53) and serum (CA 19-9) tumor markers. In the tumor-derived tissue, both tumor cells and blood vessels expressed Cav-1. In contrast, in peritumoral tissue, Cav-1 expression was confined mainly to blood vessels and was only occasionally expressed in ductal or parenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the overexpression of Cav-1 in pancreatic tumors compared with peritumoral tissue. Cav-1 expression in tumor tissues was correlated with both the Ki-67 LI (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001) and p53 expression (chi2 = 9.91, P < 0.005). Overexpression of Cav-1 was associated with tumor size, grade and stage and Cav-1 expression in tumors was correlated with an increased serum level of CA 19-9 (r = 0.795, P < 0.001). Based on the results of this study, the inclusion of Cav-1 in a putative panel of biomarkers predicting pancreatic cancer aggressiveness is warranted."

Cav-1 is highly expressed in adipocytes and is abundant in mammary fat pads (stroma), but it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 within mammary stromal cells affects the differentiated state of mammary epithelia via paracrine signaling. To address this issue, we characterized the development of the mammary ductal system in Cav-1-/- mice and performed a series of mammary transplant studies, using both wild-type and Cav-1-/- mammary fat pads. Cav-1-/- mammary epithelia were hyperproliferative in vivo, with dramatic increases in terminal end bud area and mammary ductal thickness as well as increases in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 hyperactivation, and up-regulation of STAT5a and cyclin D1. Consistent with these findings, loss of Cav-1 dramatically exacerbated mammary lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia in cyclin D1 Tg mice, whereas overexpression of Cav-1 caused reversion of this phenotype. Most importantly, Cav-1-/- mammary stromal cells (fat pads) promoted the growth of both normal mammary ductal epithelia and mammary tumor cells. Thus, Cav-1 expression in both epithelial and stromal cells provides a protective effect against mammary hyperplasia as well as mammary tumorigenesis."

We show that cav-2 is expressed in the intestine where it is localized to the apical membrane and in intracellular bodies.

We also show that CAV-2 depletion suppresses the abnormal accumulation of vacuoles that result from defective basolateral recycling in rme-1 and rab-10 mutants.

The alpha(v) integrins recognize an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in some extracellular matrix proteins and in the penton base in most human Ads. Using a canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) vector, we found that CHO cells that express CAR but not wild-type CHO cells are susceptible to CAV-2 transduction. Cells expressing alpha(M)beta(2) integrins or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules but which do not express CAR were not transduced. Binding assays showed that CAV-2 attaches to a recombinant soluble form of CAR and that Ad type 5 (Ad5) fiber, penton base, and an anti-CAR antibody partially blocked attachment. Using fluorescently labeled CAV-2 particles, we found that in some cells nonpermissive for transduction, inhibition was at the point of internalization and not attachment. The transduction efficiency of CAV-2, which lacks an RGD motif, surprisingly mimicked that of Ad5 when tested in cells selectively expressing alpha(v)beta(5) and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

In this study, we have attempted to identify the cell surface molecules involved in Coxsackievirus A9 (CAV-9), a common human pathogen and a member of the Picornavirus family, infectious process. GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical.

Following Bb challenge 1 year after vaccination, all vaccinated dogs, regardless of group, showed significantly fewer clinical signs and shed significantly fewer challenge organisms than unvaccinated controls.

Our results demonstrate that CAV-2 transduction is augmented by CAR and possibly by alpha(v)beta(5), though transduction can be CAR and alpha(v)beta(3/5) independent but is alpha(M)beta(2), MHC-I, and RGD independent, demonstrating a transduction mechanism which is distinct from that of Ad2/5."

            "article": "One of the major categories of disease-causing micro-organisms are viruses. New studies on many different viruses have shown that virus attachment and cell entry is often a multistep process, requiring many interactions between the virus and cell surface molecules. In this study, we have attempted to identify the cell surface molecules involved in Coxsackievirus A9 (CAV-9), a common human pathogen and a member of the Picornavirus family, infectious process. GMK cells susceptible to virus infection were surfaced labeled with biotin and then solubilized in non-ionic and zwiterionic detergents. Free CAV-9 virions were used as an affinity surface, allowing the virus to bind to the solubilized receptors. The virus-receptor complexes were then immunoprecipitated by an anti CAV-9 serum and protein-A sepharose beads. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed the presence of integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules and a 70 kDa protein with apparent isoelectric point (pI) 5.5. The identity of the integrin alpha v beta 3 molecules was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting; whereas the 70 kDa protein was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with MHC class I molecules in non-stringent conditions. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the MHC class I associated protein (MAP-70) and the 70 kDa protein utilized by CAV-9 were identical. The role of MAP-70 in CAV-9 infectious process is discussed."

            "article": "Three groups of healthy dogs with low antibody titers to Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb), canine parainfluenza virus (CPI), and canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) were used in this study. One group was vaccinated with a single dose of monovalent attenuated Bb vaccine and one group with a trivalent vaccine containing attenuated Bb, CPI, and CAV-2; dogs were vaccinated intranasally with a single dose of the respective vaccines. The third group served as unvaccinated controls. All vaccinated dogs subsequently developed serum antibody titers to Bb that persisted for at least 1 year. Following Bb challenge 1 year after vaccination, all vaccinated dogs, regardless of group, showed significantly fewer clinical signs and shed significantly fewer challenge organisms than unvaccinated controls. These results demonstrate that intranasal administration of a single dose of monovalent attenuated Bb vaccine or trivalent vaccine containing attenuated Bb, CPI, and CAV-2 provides 1 year of protection against Bb."
