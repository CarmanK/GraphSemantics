In an audiovisual communication, a first high fram rate video signal is derived from a motion image and converted to a low fram rate low resolution multiframe signal. A second high frame rate video signal is derived from an still image and converted to a single frame high resolution signal. Because of the low frame rates, the frequencies of the low and high resolution signals are within the range of frequencies of a telephone exchange line. A switching matrix is provided to sequentially couple both the low and high resolution signals to a transmission line in response to a mode select signal. The single frame high resolution signal is stored into a memory at the receiving end and repeatedly retrieved out of the memory into a display through the switching matrix."

The first end is snugly secured about the top of the golf bag with fasteners. The first end has at least one slit therein which is received by a ring on the top of the bag preventing rotation of the cover circumferentially about the top of the bag. The second end of the bag extends outwardly from the bag covering the golf clubs and the top of the golf bag. The second end of the cover is folded back and fastened to the first end of the cover. To gain access to the golf club, the second end of the cover is lifted and the golfer may reach in to remove the golf club while still preventing rain from entering the top of the golf bag. The second end of the cover may be rolled downwardly to form a collar about the top of the golf bag and, when so disposed, the cover may be unrolled rapidly to protect the top of the golf bag and golf clubs from rain and inclement weather."
