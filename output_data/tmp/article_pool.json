The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics. The mutation of Y43L, however, did not induce a significant change in the crystal structure"

The analytical calculations were underestimated compared with the Monte Carlo calculations by less than 24% for silicon and 40% for copper, particularly at large-angle scattering, which was attributable to the buildup effect of the single-scattered X-rays in the targets. By considering the buildup effect, the difference from Monte Carlo results decreased to less than 20%. For lead, the influence of fluorescent X-rays produced by the source beam was dominant in the backward direction, which was also calculated analytically.

An acyclic MTCXXC (X is any amino acid) reference peptide previously analyzed as a potent inhibitor of ROS production underwent substitution of the cysteine residues with selenocysteine to give two singly substituted derivatives C3U and C6U and the doubly substituted analogue C3U/C6U. Presumably due to the softer nature of Se vs. S, all selenocysteine containing peptides demonstrated high affinity to Cu(i), higher than that of the reference peptide, and in the same order of magnitude as that measured for the native protein, Atox1. A stronger impact of residue 3 confirmed previous findings on its more dominant role in metal coordination. In vitro studies on the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line, MEF mice embryonic fibroblasts, and MEF with the knocked-out Atox1 gene (Atox1-/-) consistently identified C3U/C6U as the most potent inhibitor of ROS cellular production based on the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (H2DCF-DA) assay, also in comparison with known drugs employed in the clinic for Wilson's disease.

To address this deficiency, we developed the Rapid Infectious Disease Identification (RIDI\u00e2\u0084\u00a2) system. The system requires minimal guidance, which reduces operator errors. The system is compatible with the three major NGS platforms. It automatically interfaces with the sequencing system, detects their data format, configures the analysis type, applies appropriate quality control, and analyzes the results. Sequence information is characterized using both the NCBI database and RIDI\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 specific databases. RIDI\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 was designed to identify high probability sequence matches and more divergent matches that could represent different or novel species. We challenged the system using defined American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) reference standards of 27 species, both individually and in varying combinations. The system was able to rapidly detect known organisms in <12h with multi-sample throughput. The system accurately identifies 99.5% of the DNA sequence reads at the genus-level and 75.3% at the species-level in reference standards. It has a limit of detection of 146cells/ml in simulated clinical samples, and is also able to identify the components of polymicrobial samples with 16.9% discrepancy at the genus-level and 31.2% at the species-level.

The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4\u00a0\u00c5. While the combination of metals is reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I) centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis. Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA."

The analytical calculations were underestimated compared with the Monte Carlo calculations by less than 24% for silicon and 40% for copper, particularly at large-angle scattering, which was attributable to the buildup effect of the single-scattered X-rays in the targets. By considering the buildup effect, the difference from Monte Carlo results decreased to less than 20%.

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin.

The MCD signal is extremely weak for low energy transitions in the linear oligomers, but it is amplified when the cyclic porphyrin hexamer binds a template, restricting rotational freedom. The appearance of Faraday A terms in the MCD spectra demonstrates the presence of a magnetic moment, and thus, uncompensated electronic current. The value of the excited state magnetic moment estimated from the A term is very low compared with those of monomeric porphyrins, which confirms the nonaromatic character of the cyclic array and the lack of a global ring current in the ground state of the neutral nanoring. DFT calculations predict the absorption and MCD patterns reasonably well, but fail to reproduce the MCD sign inversion observed in substituted monomeric zinc porphyrins (\"soft\" chromophores). Interestingly, a correct sign pattern is predicted by INDO/S calculations. Analysis of the MCD spectra of the monomeric porphyrin unit allowed us to distinguish between two close-lying lowest energy transitions, which some previous assignments placed further apart. The present results prove the usefulness of MCD not only for deconvolution and assignment of electronic transitions, but also as a sensitive tool for detecting electronic ring currents"

An alpha-chain variant with a substitution of a glutamate for valine at NA-1 and having an acetylated methionine NH2 terminus In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface"

Such a vinylogous Mannich-type reaction was found to produce diastereoisomeric butenolides in good yields and in most cases high enantiomeric excesses. The configurational assignment of the obtained products was safely performed by chemical correlation. A computational study of the transition state allowed rationalizing the obtained stereochemical outcome, highlighting the possible binding modes of the catalyst-imine-nucleophile transition complex."

Although many of these enzymes are bifunctional, mediating both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of downstream targets, the molecular details of this central regulatory switch are unclear. We showed recently that the universal second messenger cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) drives Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle progression by forcing the cell cycle kinase CckA from its default kinase into phosphatase mode. We use a combination of structure determination, modeling, and functional analysis to demonstrate that c-di-GMP reciprocally regulates the two antagonistic CckA activities through noncovalent cross-linking of the catalytic domain with the dimerization histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain. We demonstrate that both c-di-GMP and ADP (adenosine diphosphate) promote phosphatase activity and propose that c-di-GMP stabilizes the ADP-bound quaternary structure, which allows the receiver domain to access the dimeric DHp stem for dephosphorylation. In silico analyses predict that c-di-GMP control is widespread among bacterial histidine kinases, arguing that it can replace or modulate canonical transmembrane signaling"

Both isoforms contain 13 different, cysteine-free globin domains, plus a small N-terminal nonglobin \"plug\" domain with three cysteines for subunit dimerization (total M(r) approximately 238 kDa). We also identified the native hemoglobin molecule and present here a preliminary 3D reconstruction from electron microscopical images (3 nm resolution); it suggests a 3 x 2-mer quaternary structure (M(r) approximately 1.43 MDa). Moreover, we identified a previously undescribed rosette-like hemolymph protein that has been mistaken for hemoglobin. We also detected expression of an incomplete hemocyanin as trace component. The combined data show that B. glabrata hemoglobin evolved from pulmonate myoglobin, possibly to replace a less-efficient hemocyanin, and reveals a surprisingly simple evolutionary mechanism to create a high molecular mass respiratory protein from 78 similar globin domains"

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin"

The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface"

The value of the excited state magnetic moment estimated from the A term is very low compared with those of monomeric porphyrins, which confirms the nonaromatic character of the cyclic array and the lack of a global ring current in the ground state of the neutral nanoring. DFT calculations predict the absorption and MCD patterns reasonably well, but fail to reproduce the MCD sign inversion observed in substituted monomeric zinc porphyrins (\"soft\" chromophores). Interestingly, a correct sign pattern is predicted by INDO/S calculations. Analysis of the MCD spectra of the monomeric porphyrin unit allowed us to distinguish between two close-lying lowest energy transitions, which some previous assignments placed further apart. The present results prove the usefulness of MCD not only for deconvolution and assignment of electronic transitions, but also as a sensitive tool for detecting electronic ring currents"

The complexity and selectivity of rhodium porphyrins has been attractive for catalytic transformations, with specific interest in their usage for selective carbon monoxide reduction for fuel cell applications. This review will highlight historical and modern syntheses of rhodium porphyrins, as well as their respective reactions with small molecules and applications therein.

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin"

The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al.

In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-T(High) transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the alpha subunits and one associated with the betasubunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta cluster. In the alpha subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N(epsilon)(2)His(F8)alpha1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)alpha1 and Ala88(F9)alpha1. This tension induces an alpha-to-pi transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the beta-carbon of Ala88alpha1 by approximately 1.5 A directly into the side chain of Tyr140alpha1 (a key residue in the Trp37beta2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140alpha1 into the alpha1beta2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37beta2 cluster. In the beta subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced beta1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the beta1 subunit that promote alpha1beta1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37beta2 cluster at the alpha1beta2 interface"

An alpha-chain variant with a substitution of a glutamate for valine at NA-1 and having an acetylated methionine NH2 terminus In hemoglobin (Hb) Thionville, the substitution of a glutamic acid for the alpha-chain NH2-terminal valine inhibits the cleavage of the initiator methionine which is then acetylated. The elongation of the alpha-chain NH2 terminus modifies the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at a region that is known to have an important role in the allosteric regulation of oxygen binding. Relative to Hb A, Hb Thionville has a lower affinity for oxygen, and the heterotropic allosteric effects of protons, chloride, and bezafibrate are reduced. In contrast, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is normal. Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A. The x-ray crystal structure of deoxy Hb Thionville shows that the glutamate side chain extends away from the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, whereas the methionine side chain (which has two conformations) extends into the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface, physically displacing chloride and bezafibrate. The increased stability of deoxy Hb Thionville is due to new intrasubunit and intersubunit contacts made by the methionine. These interactions replace the indirect contacts, made through bound chloride ions, that Val-1 alpha normally contributes to the alpha 1-alpha 2 interface"

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin"

However, crystallographic studies, UV and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy, CO combination kinetic measurements, and oxygen binding measurements on alphaY42A show that the intersubunit interactions formed by Tyr42alpha have only a modest influence on the structural properties and ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Therefore, the alpha1beta2 interface interactions associated with Tyr42alpha do not contribute significantly to the quaternary constraints that are responsible for the low oxygen affinity of deoxyhemoglobin. The slight increase in the ligand affinity of deoxy alphaY42A correlates with small, mutation-induced structural changes that perturb the environment of Trp37beta, a critical region of the quaternary-T alpha1beta2 interface that has been shown to be the major source of quaternary constraint in deoxyhemoglobin"

Blood and semen samples were collected from 12 healthy smoking volunteers in this study. Sperm bodies were then separated quantitatively from 1\u00c2\u00a0mL of semen samples by centrifugation. The developed method was fully validated for plasma following European and American guidelines for bioanalytical method validation, and partial validation was applied to semen analysis. Plasma, semen, and sperm samples were treated by trichloroacetic acid solution for protein direct precipitation in single extraction step. The established calibration range for Nic and Nox in plasma and semen was linear between 5 and 250\u00c2\u00a0ng/mL, and for Cot between 10 and 500\u00c2\u00a0ng/mL. Nic and Cot were detected in human sperm at concentrations as high as in plasma. In addition, Nox was present in semen and sperm but not in plasma.

To overcome the instability of the bare silver film and investigate the efficiency of the protected layer, the SAM of 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (MUD) was used as a protection layer. Stability experiment results show that the protected silver film exhibited excellent stability either in pure water or 0.01 M PBS buffer. The sensitivity of the silver-based SPR sensor was calculated to be 127.26 deg/RIU (refractive index unit), measured with different concentrations of NaCl solutions.

I.V. bolus injections of ACh induced a reproducible and dose-dependent increase in exhaled nitric oxide that was unaltered after CPB. In contrast, the increase in exhaled nitric oxide evoked by nitroglycerin was attenuated after CPB. The response in pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) to an infusion of ACh decreased after CPB, indicating endothelial dysfunction. The decrease in PVRI response to ACh correlated to the duration of CPB"

            "article": "Relaxor-based ferroelectrics are prized for their giant electromechanical coupling and have revolutionized sensor and ultrasound applications. A long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand how these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic displacements underlying the response are partially broken into polar nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics. Given the complex inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions. By using neutron scattering measurements of lattice dynamics and local structure, we show that the vibrational modes of the PNRs enable giant coupling by softening the underlying macrodomain polarization rotations in relaxor-based ferroelectric PMN-xPT {(1 - x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] - xPbTiO3} (x = 30%). The mechanism involves the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic phonons and results in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. The softer mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening. Furthermore, a PNR mode and a component of the local structure align in an electric field; this further enhances shear softening, revealing a way to tune the ultrahigh piezoelectric response by engineering elastic shear softening"

By simulation, silver-based SPR sensor has a better performance in field enhancement and penetration depth than that of a gold-based SPR sensor, which are 5 and 1.4 times, respectively. To overcome the instability of the bare silver film and investigate the efficiency of the protected layer, the SAM of 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (MUD) was used as a protection layer. Stability experiment results show that the protected silver film exhibited excellent stability either in pure water or 0.01 M PBS buffer. The sensitivity of the silver-based SPR sensor was calculated to be 127.26 deg/RIU (refractive index unit), measured with different concentrations of NaCl solutions. Further, a very high refractive resolution for the silver-based SPR sensor was found to be 2.207 \u00c3\u0097 1"
