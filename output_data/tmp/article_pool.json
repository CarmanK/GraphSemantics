The sump is formed with a laminated construction including two plastic bags, one within the other, and an intermediate plastic foam filler which has been cured to a rigid state. The top of the sump is sealed to the bulkhead and includes a ducted two-part cover plate for receiving and discharging waste material. The sump is formed below an interior deck by installing a first plastic bag connected to a first flange through an aperture in the interior deck, then placing a charge of foaming plastic resin in a substantially liquid state in the first bag, and then installing a second plastic bag connected to a second flange which covers the first flange. The inner bag is then pressurized internally, displacing the foaming resin in the outer bag and distributing it substantially evenly throughout the entire cavity or space between the two bags. Some expansion of the outer bag is accomplished by means of the foaming action of the resin. The resin eventually sets in its foamed state to provide the structural rigidity of the sump."

An automatic, variable, high speed, plastic-bag-folding machine which takes flat plastic bags, rolls, folds, flattens and packages the bags; the machine consists of a conveyor belt assembly which is fed by the discharge of a plastic-bag-making machine and which feeds the bags into rolling, folding and multibag packaging sections, all synchronized by a pneumatic control system. The machine first produces a tubular, rolled bag by feeding the bag into a circularly disposed set of centrally gaped, interdigitated driven rollers, which is then ready for withdrawal and folding. Having formed the rolled bag, an elongated compressed air nozzle located above and near the middle of the tubular bag jets or blows against the center of the tubular roll blowing the flexible bag down and out of the rolling section through its central gap, producing a half-fold; as the bag is blown out of the rolling section, it is passed between two sets of inwardly biased rollers to flatten the bag and then driven into the multi-bag packaging section. The multi-bag packaging section includes two laterally but oppositely disposed collection boxes between which is located a mechanical diverter. When the appropriate number of bags have been folded and collected in one collection box, the collected bags are transferred into a commercial packaging box, while the subsequently folded bags are diverted into the other collection box and the sequence continuously repeated."

The time interval between two seal bar reciprocations represents a bag making cycle and the number of bag making cycles per minute is the production rate of the machine. Bags produced by the machine are discharged between stacking guides that constrain the bags to fall into a neatly registered stack on an index conveyor at the cyclical rate of bag production. When a predetermined bag count per stack is reached, bag production is interrupted for a period known as an interrupt cycle, during which the index conveyor moves the stack of bags, relative to the stacking guides, at a rate independently of the bag making cycle. Upon resumption of bag production, a second stack of bags is formed in shinglelike fashion relative to the first stack and the operation is repeated. Since indexing is performed during an interrupt cycle which is independent of the bag making cycle, the production rate of the machine can be increased to a maximum by using a bag making cycle that is less than an indexing time interval."

If a logical relationship between the slip status signal and the slip level signal is abnormal, and if the prime mover for driving the driving wheels is not accelerating and at the same time the slip level signal indicates the predetermined slip state, the slip level signal is determined to be abnormal. If an abnormality is detected during driving wheel slip control, an amount of reduction in output of the driving wheels is set to a predetermined amount to thereby continue driving wheel slip control, until the prime mover enters an operating condition other than acceleration. Further, the system comprises first and second control units. The latter informs the former of three states for determining whether or not driving wheel slip control can be carried out. The first control unit has the slip level signal-generating device and the slip status signal-generating device, and inhibition of operation of these devices is retarded when it is informed of a state inhibiting driving wheel slip control, if an excessive slip state of the driving wheels is occurring."

As each road surface has unique tractive characteristics, the amount of brake pressure required to produce critical wheel slip, and hence maximum brake force, varies for different coefficient of friction road surfaces. This invention determines the coefficient of friction for the operating surface and adjusts the system slip threshold to accurately mimic the actual critical slip value for the road surface.
