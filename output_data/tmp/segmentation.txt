Method and system for <phrase>high</phrase>-speed, <phrase>high</phrase>-resolution, 3-D imaging of an object at a vision <phrase>station</phrase>. A method and system for <phrase>high</phrase>-speed, <phrase>high</phrase>-resolution, 3-D imaging of an object including an <phrase>anamorphic</phrase> <phrase>magnification</phrase> and <phrase>field lens</phrase> system to deliver the <phrase>light</phrase> reflected from the object to a <phrase>small area</phrase> <phrase>position detector</phrase> having a <phrase>position-sensing</phrase> direction. Preferably, an <phrase>acousto-optic</phrase> deflector together with associated <phrase>lens</phrase> elements scans a <phrase>beam</phrase> of <phrase>modulated laser</phrase> <phrase>light</phrase> across the object to produce a telecentric, flat field scan. The deflector has a <phrase>feedback loop</phrase> to enable <phrase>uniform illumination</phrase> of the object. The <phrase>light</phrase> scattered from the object is collected by a telecentric <phrase>receiver</phrase> <phrase>lens</phrase>. A combined spatial and polarization filtering plane preferably in the form of a programmable mask is provided to control the polarization and acceptance angles of the collected <phrase>light</phrase>. A reduction or <phrase>focusing lens</phrase> is positioned <phrase>immediately behind</phrase> the filtering plane and is utilized as a <phrase>telescope</phrase> objective. The <phrase>lens</phrase> system includes a negative cylinder <phrase>lens</phrase> having a relatively large <phrase>focal length</phrase> and a <phrase>field lens</phrase> having a relatively small <phrase>focal length</phrase>. The cylinder <phrase>lens</phrase> and the reduction <phrase>lens</phrase> magnify the image in the <phrase>position sensing</phrase> direction of the detector and the <phrase>field lens</phrase> delivers the magnified <phrase>light</phrase> to the detector. The detector is a <phrase>photodetector</phrase> such as a lateral effect <phrase>photodiode</phrase> or a rectangular lateral effect detector. A <phrase>pre-amplifier</phrase> provides a pair of <phrase>electrical signals</phrase> which are utilized by <phrase>signal processing</phrase> circuitry to compute the <phrase>centroid</phrase> of the <phrase>light</phrase> spot.
