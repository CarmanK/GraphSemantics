["Structural insights into the role of iron-histidine bond cleavage in nitric oxide-induced activation of H-NOX gas sensor proteins Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria", "Quinol Oxidation by C-Type Cytochromes: Structural Characterization of the Menaquinol Binding Site of Nrfha Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases", " A long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand how these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic displacements underlying the response are partially broken into polar nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics", " Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm", "Structures of Noncoordinated Aromatic Residue Mutants in Tetraheme Cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki  "]
