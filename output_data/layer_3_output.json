The replacement of tyrosine with leucine increased the redox potential of heme 1 by 44 and 35 mV at the first and last reduction steps, respectively; its effects on the other hemes are small. In contrast, the Y43F mutation hardly changed the potentials. It shows that the aromatic ring at this position contributes to lowering the redox potential of heme 1 locally, although this cannot be the major contribution to the extremely low redox potentials of cytochrome c(3). Furthermore, temperature-dependent line-width broadening in partially reduced samples established that the aromatic ring at position 43 participates in the control of the kinetics of intramolecular electron transfer. The rate of reduction of Y43L cytochrome c(3) by 5-deazariboflavin semiquinone under partially reduced conditions was significantly different from that of the wild type in the last stage of the reduction, supporting the involvement of Tyr43 in regulation of reduction kinetics.

However, the underlying biophysical mechanisms that give rise to modal gating in this and most other channels remain unknown. Although ion channels are composed of protein subunits, previous mathematical models of modal gating are coarse grained at the level of whole-channel states, limiting further dialogue between theory and experiment. Here we propose an origin for modal gating, by modeling the kinetics of ligand binding and conformational change in the IP3R at the subunit level. We find good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of ligand concentrations, accounting for equilibrium channel properties, transient responses to changing ligand conditions, and modal gating statistics. We show how this can be understood within a simple analytical framework and confirm our results with stochastic simulations. The model assumes that channel subunits are independent, demonstrating that cooperative binding or concerted conformational changes are not required for modal gating.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described.

Femtosecond time-resolved small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-SWAXS) is capable of tracking such ultrafast protein dynamics. However, because the structural interpretation of the experiments is complicated, a molecular picture of protein quakes has remained elusive. In addition, new questions arose from recent TR-SWAXS data that were interpreted as underdamped oscillations of an entire protein, thus challenging the long-standing concept of overdamped global protein dynamics. Based on molecular-dynamics simulations, we present a detailed molecular movie of the protein quake after carbon monoxide (CO) photodissociation in myoglobin. The simulations suggest that the protein quake is characterized by a single pressure peak that propagates anisotropically within 500 fs across the protein and further into the solvent. By computing TR-SWAXS patterns from the simulations, we could interpret features in the reciprocal-space SWAXS signals as specific real-space dynamics, such as CO displacement and pressure wave propagation. Remarkably, we found that the small-angle data primarily detect modulations of the solvent density but not oscillations of the bare protein, thereby reconciling recent TR-SWAXS experiments with the notion of overdamped global protein dynamics"}, {"phrase": "nitric oxide Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations", "id": "5123", "article": "Basal exhaled nitric oxide and the response in exhaled nitric oxide to i.v. injections of ACh and nitroglycerin were measured with chemiluminescence in 10 patients before and after open-heart surgery"}, {"phrase": "nitric oxide Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations", "id": "932", "article": "An increasing number of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crystal structures provide important-albeit static-pictures of how small molecules or peptides interact with their receptors.

A long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand how these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic displacements underlying the response are partially broken into polar nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics. Given the complex inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions. By using neutron scattering measurements of lattice dynamics and local structure, we show that the vibrational modes of the PNRs enable giant coupling by softening the underlying macrodomain polarization rotations in relaxor-based ferroelectric PMN-xPT {(1 - x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] - xPbTiO3} (x = 30%). The mechanism involves the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic phonons and results in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. The softer mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening. Furthermore, a PNR mode and a component of the local structure align in an electric field; this further enhances shear softening, revealing a way to tune the ultrahigh piezoelectric response by engineering elastic shear softening"}, {"phrase": "polar sensor", "id": "12882", "article": "This study showed that exposure of a LiDCO sensor to blood after a single clinically relevant dose of xylazine in horses changed the voltages of the sensors for 15 min.

In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82.

However, the underlying biophysical mechanisms that give rise to modal gating in this and most other channels remain unknown. Although ion channels are composed of protein subunits, previous mathematical models of modal gating are coarse grained at the level of whole-channel states, limiting further dialogue between theory and experiment.

We find good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of ligand concentrations, accounting for equilibrium channel properties, transient responses to changing ligand conditions, and modal gating statistics. We show how this can be understood within a simple analytical framework and confirm our results with stochastic simulations. The model assumes that channel subunits are independent, demonstrating that cooperative binding or concerted conformational changes are not required for modal gating.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface.

However, knowledge obtained through crystallography is limited to static structural information. Less information is available showing how a ligand associates with or dissociates from a given receptor, whose importance is in fact increasingly recognized by the drug research community. Owing to recent advances in computer power and algorithms, molecular dynamics stimulations have become feasible that help in analyzing the kinetics of the ligand binding process. Here, we review what is currently known about the dynamics of GPCRs in the context of ligand association and dissociation, as determined through both crystallography and computer simulations.

In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82.

Although they are unique in binding exclusively to phosphothreonine, the basis for this discrimination over phosphoserine has remained elusive. Here, we attempt to dissect overall binding specificity at the molecular level. We first determined the optimal peptide sequence for Rv0020c FHA domain binding by oriented peptide library screening. This served as a basis for systematic mutagenic and binding analyses, allowing us to derive relative thermodynamic contributions of conserved protein and peptide residues to binding and specificity. Structures of phosphopeptide-bound and uncomplexed Rv0020c FHA domain then directed molecular dynamics simulations which show how the extraordinary discrimination in favor of phosphothreonine occurs through formation of additional hydrogen-bonding networks that are ultimately stabilized by van der Waals interactions of the phosphothreonine \u00ce\u00b3-methyl group with a conserved pocket on the FHA domain surface"}]
