[" This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect", " (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the alpha1beta2 interface that is centered at Trp37beta", " Analysis of oxygen equilibrium data within the framework of the two-state allosteric model indicates that the structure of deoxy Hb Thionville is stabilized relative to that of deoxy Hb A", " (Gerberding et al 1990, Panlilio et al 1991, Popejoy & Fry 1991, Quebbeman et al 1991, Tokars et al 1992, Lynch & White 1993, Stringer, Infante-Rivard & Hanley 2002)", " A new synthetic approach for multifunctional porphyrins was developed using alpha,beta-unsaturated acyl porphyrins as versatile building blocks with yields of 44-95%", " Although both hemes of alpha and beta subunits in metHb A take a six-coordinate (6c) high-spin structure, the 406"]
