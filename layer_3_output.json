During sepsis, changes occur within the microcirculation including alterations in arteriolar tone influencing blood pressure, adaptations to endothelial cell integrity causing leakage of proteins and macromolecules, and adhesion and migration of leucocytes through the vascular endothelium. Statins are widely used as cholesterol-lowering agents, but appear to have anti-inflammatory actions during sepsis. We have discussed the effects of statins on specific pathological processed within the microcirculation and focused on the role of nitric oxide (NO). The main mechanism by which statins appear to be an effective treatment for sepsis is increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), in conjunction with down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Combined, this results in an increase in physiological concentrations of NO, thus restoring endothelial function. Laboratory studies have therefore suggested that enhancement of eNOS activity during sepsis may lead to restoration of microvascular tone, maintenance of microvascular integrity, and inhibition of cell adhesion molecules. However, other mechanisms independent of lipid-lowering effects, including antioxidant activity and alterations in the development of vascular atherosclerosis, may also contribute to the beneficial effects of statins.

Baicalein abolished the endotoxin/cytokine-induced expression of iNOS protein, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS promoter activity in a parallel concentration-dependent manner. The suppression of iNOS expression was not mediated through the down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by baicalein because TNF-alpha failed to enhance endotoxin/cytokine-induced NO production in microglia.

A long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand how these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic displacements underlying the response are partially broken into polar nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics. Given the complex inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions. By using neutron scattering measurements of lattice dynamics and local structure, we show that the vibrational modes of the PNRs enable giant coupling by softening the underlying macrodomain polarization rotations in relaxor-based ferroelectric PMN-xPT {(1 - x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] - xPbTiO3} (x = 30%). The mechanism involves the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic phonons and results in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. The softer mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening. Furthermore, a PNR mode and a component of the local structure align in an electric field; this further enhances shear softening, revealing a way to tune the ultrahigh piezoelectric response by engineering elastic shear softening"}, {"phrase": "NOX polar", "id": "12166", "article": "In total, 210 paired measurements were compared.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm.

These tethered bilayer lipid membranes tBLM were formed on a commercially available chemically modified gold substrate. These lipid bilayers are very robust. Very high-resolution electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the dielectric structure of the lipid bilayers and associated interfaces. The EIS data allowed the dielectric substructure of the lipid bilayers to be determined. The results showed that when cholesterol was present in the tethered membranes at a concentration of 10% (mol/mol); the thickness of the tBLMs increased and the membrane conductance decreased. However, when cholesterol was present in the tethered membrane at more than 30% (mol/mol) the effect of cholesterol was dramatically different; the membranes then became thinner and possessed a much larger electrical conductance. The EIS allowed a distinction to be made between a hydrophobic region in the center of the bilayer and another hydrophobic region further out towards the polar head region, in addition to the polar head region itself.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

In this paper, an optical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor modified by the glucose/galactose-binding (GGB) protein which has good affinity to glucose molecules was presented for specific and sensitive glucose detection. The GGB protein was mutated at different sites for thiol coupling with the SPR surface and adjusting the affinity between glucose molecules and GGB protein. And the immobilization process of the GGB protein onto the surface of SPR sensor was optimized. Then, the stability of the SPR sensor modified with GGB protein was tested immediately and two weeks after immobilization.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin and developed airway inflammation and oxidative lung damage. Artesunate markedly suppressed ovalbumin-induced increases in total cell, eosinophil, and neutrophil counts. In contrast, dexamethasone failed to inhibit neutrophil recruitment. Levels of the oxidative damage markers 8-isoprostane, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, and 3-nitrotyrosine were potently repressed by artesunate.

This paper examines the problem of stain decomposition, which is a naturally nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem in algebra, and introduces a systematical and analytical solution consisting of a circular color analysis module and an NMF-based computation module. Unlike the paradigm of existing stain decomposition algorithms where stain proportions are computed from estimated stain spectra using a matrix inverse operation directly, the introduced solution estimates stain spectra and stain depths via probabilistic reasoning individually. Since the proposed method pays extra attentions to achromatic pixels in color analysis and stain co-occurrence in pixel clustering, it achieves consistent and reliable stain decomposition with minimum decomposition residue. Particularly, aware of the periodic and angular nature of hue, we propose the use of a circular von Mises mixture model to analyze the hue distribution, and provide a complete color-based pixel soft-clustering solution to address color mixing introduced by stain overlap.

The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al.

In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitions-referred to as T-to-T(High) transitions-between the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37beta cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-T(High) quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the alpha1beta1 dimer relative to the alpha2beta2 dimer as well as a coupled alphabeta dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the alpha1 subunit relative to the beta1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the alpha2 subunit relative to the beta2 subunit).

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface.

In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82.

At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-.

Accordingly, the mechanisms of binding and cross-reactivity are very different between the two TCRs: whereas A6 relies on conformational selection to select and bind different ligands, DMF5 uses a more rigid, permissive architecture with greater reliance on slower motions or induced-fit. In addition to binding site flexibility, we also explored whether ligand-binding resulted in common dynamical changes in A6 and DMF5 that could contribute to TCR triggering.

We show that such behavior can be explained by considering lateral electrostatic effects (within the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory) combined with the coupling between lateral and longitudinal degrees of freedom due to the conserved polymer volume (which are neglected in scaling arguments). We also take the non-linear elasticity of polyelectrolyte chains into consideration, which makes significant effects as chains are almost fully stretched in the osmotic regime. It is shown that all these factors lead to a non-monotonic behavior for the brush height as a function of the grafting density. At large grafting densities, the brush height increases with increasing the grafting density due to the volume constraint. At small grafting densities, we obtain a re-stretching of the chains for decreasing grafting density, which is caused by lateral electrostatic contributions and is controlled by the counterion-condensation process around polyelectrolyte chains.

There is tremendous progress in both the scientific understanding and the applications of self-assemblies of single-type identical particles. Forming superstructures in which the colloidal particles occupy predesigned sites and remain in these sites despite thermal fluctuations represents a major challenge of the current state of the art. We propose a versatile approach to directing placement of colloids using nematic liquid crystals with spatially varying molecular orientation preimposed by substrate photoalignment. Colloidal particles in a nematic environment are subject to the long-range elastic forces originating in the orientational order of the nematic. Gradients of the orientational order create an elastic energy landscape that drives the colloids into locations with preferred type of deformations. As an example, we demonstrate that colloidal spheres with perpendicular surface anchoring are driven into the regions of maximum splay, whereas spheres with tangential surface anchoring settle into the regions of bend. Elastic forces responsible for preferential placement are measured by exploring overdamped dynamics of the colloids.

V(max) of the high affinity phase of human 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activity was 96.9 +/- 19.0 pmol mg(-1) min(-1) and the activity of the corresponding phase in the rat was 2.7 times greater.

Despite this, few CYP450s have been functionally characterized in model plants and roles of fewer CYP450s are known in non-model, medicinal, and aromatic plants. Our study in Coleus forskohlii indicates that flavone synthase (CYP93B) and flavonoid 3' monooxygenase (CYP706C) are key enzymes positioned at a metabolic junction, to execute the biosynthesis of different sub-classes of flavonoids (flavones, flavonol, anthocynanin, isoflavones etc.) from a common precursor. Such branch points are favored targets for artificially modulating the metabolic flux toward specific metabolites, through genetic manipulation or use of elicitors that differentially impact the expression of branch point genes. Genkwanin, the only flavone reported from C. forskohlii, is known to possess anti-inflammatory activity. It is biosynthesized from the general flavonoid precursor: naringenin. Two differentially expressed cytochrome P450 genes (CfCYP93B, CfCYP706C), exhibiting maximum expression in leaf tissues, were isolated from C. forskohlii. Mannitol treatment resulted in increased expression of CfCYP93B and decrease in expression of CfCYP706C. Metabolite quantification data showed that genkwanin content increased and anthocyanin levels decreased in response to mannitol treatment. Alignment, phylogenetic analysis, modeling, and molecular docking analysis of protein sequences suggested that CfCYP93B may be involved in conversion of naringenin to flavones (possibly genkwanin via apigenin), while CfCYP706C may act on common precursors of flavonoid metabolism and channel the substrate toward production of flavonols or anthocynanins. Decrease in expression of CfCYP706C and increase in accumulation of genkwanin suggested that mannitol treatment may possibly lead to accumulation of genkwanin via suppression of a competitive branch of flavonoids in C. forskohlii."}, {"phrase": "NOX Cytochrome", "id": "846", "article": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors that can activate or inhibit the expression of many target genes by forming a heterodimer complex with the retinoid X receptor (RXR).

Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin and developed airway inflammation and oxidative lung damage. Artesunate markedly suppressed ovalbumin-induced increases in total cell, eosinophil, and neutrophil counts. In contrast, dexamethasone failed to inhibit neutrophil recruitment. Levels of the oxidative damage markers 8-isoprostane, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, and 3-nitrotyrosine were potently repressed by artesunate. However, dexamethasone showed weaker inhibitory effects on 3-nitrotyrosine production. Ovalbumin-induced increases in the expression of the pro-oxidants iNOS and NADPH oxidase (NOX1, 2, 3, and 4) were significantly abated by artesunate. Gene expression of regulatory subunits of NOX, p22phox and p67phox, was also reduced by artesunate.

However, it has not been reported that any fluorescence imaging tools could allow simultaneous visualization of Cyt c translocation and caspase-3 activation in apoptotic cells. Here, we develop a sensitive nanosensor that holds the capability of imaging of the released Cyt c from the mitochondria and a caspase-3 activation cascade reaction in apoptotic signaling. The nanosensor is constructed by the assembly of a fluorophore (Cy5)-tagged DNA aptamer on graphene nanosheets that have been covalently immobilized with a FAM-labeled peptide. After a spatially selective delivery into the cytoplasm, the Cy5-tagged DNA aptamer assembled on the nanosensor can bind with Cyt c released from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and dissociate from graphene, triggering a red fluorescence signal. In addition, the caspase-3 activated by the Cyt c released to the cytoplasm can cleave the FAM-labeled peptide and result in a green fluorescence output. The nanosensor exhibits rapid response, high sensitivity and selectivity for in vitro assays, and high contrast imaging of Cyt c and caspase-3 in living cells. It also provides the method for the study of the kinetic relationship between the Cyt c translocation and caspase-3 activation through simultaneous imaging of Cyt c and caspase-3.

It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to 5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion.

We have discussed the effects of statins on specific pathological processed within the microcirculation and focused on the role of nitric oxide (NO).

Combined, this results in an increase in physiological concentrations of NO, thus restoring endothelial function. Laboratory studies have therefore suggested that enhancement of eNOS activity during sepsis may lead to restoration of microvascular tone, maintenance of microvascular integrity, and inhibition of cell adhesion molecules.

Given the complex inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions.

The mechanism involves the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic phonons and results in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. The softer mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening.

In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

However, only a minute volume of ISF could be transdermally extracted, which is required to be diluted to form a manipulable volume of fluid for easy collection, transportation, and glucose detection. Therefore, a high-resolution glucose detection method is required for detecting glucose concentration in diluted ISF. In this paper, an optical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor modified by the glucose/galactose-binding (GGB) protein which has good affinity to glucose molecules was presented for specific and sensitive glucose detection. The GGB protein was mutated at different sites for thiol coupling with the SPR surface and adjusting the affinity between glucose molecules and GGB protein.

Then, the stability of the SPR sensor modified with GGB protein was tested immediately and two weeks after immobilization.

The increased human receptor-affinity is in the same range as that of the HA from highly transmissible seasonal and 1918 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Moreover, a 2009 H1N1 virus carrying this mutation in the RBS (generated using reverse genetics) transmits efficiently in ferrets by respiratory droplets thereby reestablishing our previously observed correlation between human receptor-binding affinity and transmission efficiency.

We used data from experiments on the kinases ATM/ATR and CDK1, and curated CK2 substrates to evaluate the prevalence of interactions between substrate positions within a motif and the utility of these interactions in predicting kinase substrates.

This feature of channel behavior has pronounced implications for the dynamics of ionic currents and the signaling pathways that they regulate. A canonical example is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) channel, whose regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration is essential for numerous cellular processes. However, the underlying biophysical mechanisms that give rise to modal gating in this and most other channels remain unknown. Although ion channels are composed of protein subunits, previous mathematical models of modal gating are coarse grained at the level of whole-channel states, limiting further dialogue between theory and experiment. Here we propose an origin for modal gating, by modeling the kinetics of ligand binding and conformational change in the IP3R at the subunit level. We find good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of ligand concentrations, accounting for equilibrium channel properties, transient responses to changing ligand conditions, and modal gating statistics. We show how this can be understood within a simple analytical framework and confirm our results with stochastic simulations. The model assumes that channel subunits are independent, demonstrating that cooperative binding or concerted conformational changes are not required for modal gating. Moreover, the model embodies a generally applicable principle: If a timescale separation exists in the kinetics of individual subunits, then modal gating can arise as an emergent property of channel behavior"}, {"phrase": "gas Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations", "id": "924", "article": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins and represent the largest class of drug targets.

At large grafting densities, the brush height increases with increasing the grafting density due to the volume constraint.

Previous investigations have revealed that estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u00ce\u00b1) plays a critical role in breast cancer. More recently, observations regarding the widespread expression of ER\u00ce\u00b2-like proteins in normal and neoplastic mammary tissues have suggested that ER\u00ce\u00b2 is also involved in the mentioned pathology. Design of new drugs both steroidal and nonsteroidal that target any of these receptors represents a promise to treat breast cancer. In this work we propose a new set of compounds that could effectively target the estrogen receptors ER\u00ce\u00b1 and ER\u00ce\u00b2. These ligands were designed based on the chemical structure of the ER\u00ce\u00b2-selective agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN). The designed ligands were submitted to in silico ADMET studies, yielding in a filtered list of ligands that showed better drug-like properties. Molecular dynamics simulations of both estrogen receptors and docking analysis were carried-out employing the designed compounds, from which two of them were chosen due to their their promising characteristics retrieved from theoretical results (docking analysis or targeting receptor predictions). They were chemically synthetized and during the process, two precursor ligands were also obtained. These four ligands were subjected to biological studies from which it could be detected that compound mol60b displayed inhibitory activity and its ability to activate the transcription via an estrogenic mechanism of action was also determined.

This parcellation was then used as a basis for analyzing the receptor expression for 15 receptor types. Receptor fingerprints, i.e., the characteristic balance between densities of all receptor types, were generated in each subdivision to comprehensively visualize differences and similarities in receptor architecture between the subdivisions. Fingerprints of the central and medial nuclei and the anterior amygdaloid area were highly similar. Fingerprints of the lateral, basolateral and basomedial nuclei were also similar to each other, while those of the remaining nuclei were distinct in shape. Similarities were further investigated by a hierarchical cluster analysis: a two-cluster solution subdivided the phylogenetically older part (central, medial nuclei, anterior amygdaloid area) from the remaining parts of the amygdala. A more fine-grained three-cluster solution replicated our previous parcellation including a laterobasal, superficial and centromedial group. Furthermore, it helped to better characterize the paralaminar nucleus with a molecular organization in-between the laterobasal and the superficial group.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

Statins are widely used as cholesterol-lowering agents, but appear to have anti-inflammatory actions during sepsis. We have discussed the effects of statins on specific pathological processed within the microcirculation and focused on the role of nitric oxide (NO). The main mechanism by which statins appear to be an effective treatment for sepsis is increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), in conjunction with down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Combined, this results in an increase in physiological concentrations of NO, thus restoring endothelial function. Laboratory studies have therefore suggested that enhancement of eNOS activity during sepsis may lead to restoration of microvascular tone, maintenance of microvascular integrity, and inhibition of cell adhesion molecules.

Baicalein, a polyphenolic flavonoid antioxidant, is known to have anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and neuroprotective effects. In the present study, we report the inhibitory effect of baicalein on endotoxin/cytokine-induced NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression in microglia. Baicalein abolished the endotoxin/cytokine-induced expression of iNOS protein, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS promoter activity in a parallel concentration-dependent manner. The suppression of iNOS expression was not mediated through the down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by baicalein because TNF-alpha failed to enhance endotoxin/cytokine-induced NO production in microglia. From the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we found that baicalein exerted a distinct inhibitory effect on the DNA binding activity of transcription factors, and this was significantly greater in nuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL6) than in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activated protein 1 (AP-1). Although extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is critical to iNOS expression, endotoxin/cytokine-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not significantly inhibited by baicalein. These results indicate that NF-IL6 inactivation could be the major determinant for the suppression of NO production by baicalein in microglia.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria.

From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity.

In the present study, we report the inhibitory effect of baicalein on endotoxin/cytokine-induced NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression in microglia. Baicalein abolished the endotoxin/cytokine-induced expression of iNOS protein, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS promoter activity in a parallel concentration-dependent manner. The suppression of iNOS expression was not mediated through the down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by baicalein because TNF-alpha failed to enhance endotoxin/cytokine-induced NO production in microglia. From the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we found that baicalein exerted a distinct inhibitory effect on the DNA binding activity of transcription factors, and this was significantly greater in nuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL6) than in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activated protein 1 (AP-1). Although extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is critical to iNOS expression, endotoxin/cytokine-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not significantly inhibited by baicalein.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria.

During sepsis, changes occur within the microcirculation including alterations in arteriolar tone influencing blood pressure, adaptations to endothelial cell integrity causing leakage of proteins and macromolecules, and adhesion and migration of leucocytes through the vascular endothelium. Statins are widely used as cholesterol-lowering agents, but appear to have anti-inflammatory actions during sepsis. We have discussed the effects of statins on specific pathological processed within the microcirculation and focused on the role of nitric oxide (NO). The main mechanism by which statins appear to be an effective treatment for sepsis is increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), in conjunction with down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Combined, this results in an increase in physiological concentrations of NO, thus restoring endothelial function. Laboratory studies have therefore suggested that enhancement of eNOS activity during sepsis may lead to restoration of microvascular tone, maintenance of microvascular integrity, and inhibition of cell adhesion molecules. However, other mechanisms independent of lipid-lowering effects, including antioxidant activity and alterations in the development of vascular atherosclerosis, may also contribute to the beneficial effects of statins.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria.

From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

During sepsis, changes occur within the microcirculation including alterations in arteriolar tone influencing blood pressure, adaptations to endothelial cell integrity causing leakage of proteins and macromolecules, and adhesion and migration of leucocytes through the vascular endothelium. Statins are widely used as cholesterol-lowering agents, but appear to have anti-inflammatory actions during sepsis. We have discussed the effects of statins on specific pathological processed within the microcirculation and focused on the role of nitric oxide (NO). The main mechanism by which statins appear to be an effective treatment for sepsis is increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), in conjunction with down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Combined, this results in an increase in physiological concentrations of NO, thus restoring endothelial function. Laboratory studies have therefore suggested that enhancement of eNOS activity during sepsis may lead to restoration of microvascular tone, maintenance of microvascular integrity, and inhibition of cell adhesion molecules.

In the present study, we report the inhibitory effect of baicalein on endotoxin/cytokine-induced NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression in microglia. Baicalein abolished the endotoxin/cytokine-induced expression of iNOS protein, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS promoter activity in a parallel concentration-dependent manner. The suppression of iNOS expression was not mediated through the down-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by baicalein because TNF-alpha failed to enhance endotoxin/cytokine-induced NO production in microglia. From the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we found that baicalein exerted a distinct inhibitory effect on the DNA binding activity of transcription factors, and this was significantly greater in nuclear factor IL-6 (NF-IL6) than in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activated protein 1 (AP-1). Although extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is critical to iNOS expression, endotoxin/cytokine-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not significantly inhibited by baicalein.

The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described.

The simulations suggest that the protein quake is characterized by a single pressure peak that propagates anisotropically within 500 fs across the protein and further into the solvent. By computing TR-SWAXS patterns from the simulations, we could interpret features in the reciprocal-space SWAXS signals as specific real-space dynamics, such as CO displacement and pressure wave propagation.

During sepsis, changes occur within the microcirculation including alterations in arteriolar tone influencing blood pressure, adaptations to endothelial cell integrity causing leakage of proteins and macromolecules, and adhesion and migration of leucocytes through the vascular endothelium. Statins are widely used as cholesterol-lowering agents, but appear to have anti-inflammatory actions during sepsis. We have discussed the effects of statins on specific pathological processed within the microcirculation and focused on the role of nitric oxide (NO). The main mechanism by which statins appear to be an effective treatment for sepsis is increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), in conjunction with down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Combined, this results in an increase in physiological concentrations of NO, thus restoring endothelial function. Laboratory studies have therefore suggested that enhancement of eNOS activity during sepsis may lead to restoration of microvascular tone, maintenance of microvascular integrity, and inhibition of cell adhesion molecules. However, other mechanisms independent of lipid-lowering effects, including antioxidant activity and alterations in the development of vascular atherosclerosis, may also contribute to the beneficial effects of statins.

Baicalein abolished the endotoxin/cytokine-induced expression of iNOS protein, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS promoter activity in a parallel concentration-dependent manner.

A long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand how these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic displacements underlying the response are partially broken into polar nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics. Given the complex inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions. By using neutron scattering measurements of lattice dynamics and local structure, we show that the vibrational modes of the PNRs enable giant coupling by softening the underlying macrodomain polarization rotations in relaxor-based ferroelectric PMN-xPT {(1 - x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] - xPbTiO3} (x = 30%). The mechanism involves the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic phonons and results in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. The softer mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening. Furthermore, a PNR mode and a component of the local structure align in an electric field; this further enhances shear softening, revealing a way to tune the ultrahigh piezoelectric response by engineering elastic shear softening"}, {"phrase": "polar sensor", "id": "12882", "article": "This study showed that exposure of a LiDCO sensor to blood after a single clinically relevant dose of xylazine in horses changed the voltages of the sensors for 15 min.

Therefore, a high-resolution glucose detection method is required for detecting glucose concentration in diluted ISF. In this paper, an optical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor modified by the glucose/galactose-binding (GGB) protein which has good affinity to glucose molecules was presented for specific and sensitive glucose detection. The GGB protein was mutated at different sites for thiol coupling with the SPR surface and adjusting the affinity between glucose molecules and GGB protein. And the immobilization process of the GGB protein onto the surface of SPR sensor was optimized. Then, the stability of the SPR sensor modified with GGB protein was tested immediately and two weeks after immobilization.

By further mutation of the GGB protein at the A213S and L238S sites, the measurement range of the SPR sensor was adjusted to 0.1-100 mg/dL, which matches the glucose concentration range of 5-10 times diluted ISF (3-100 mg/dL).

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface.

A long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand how these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic displacements underlying the response are partially broken into polar nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics. Given the complex inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions. By using neutron scattering measurements of lattice dynamics and local structure, we show that the vibrational modes of the PNRs enable giant coupling by softening the underlying macrodomain polarization rotations in relaxor-based ferroelectric PMN-xPT {(1 - x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] - xPbTiO3} (x = 30%). The mechanism involves the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic phonons and results in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. The softer mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening.

These tethered bilayer lipid membranes tBLM were formed on a commercially available chemically modified gold substrate. These lipid bilayers are very robust. Very high-resolution electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the dielectric structure of the lipid bilayers and associated interfaces. The EIS data allowed the dielectric substructure of the lipid bilayers to be determined. The results showed that when cholesterol was present in the tethered membranes at a concentration of 10% (mol/mol); the thickness of the tBLMs increased and the membrane conductance decreased. However, when cholesterol was present in the tethered membrane at more than 30% (mol/mol) the effect of cholesterol was dramatically different; the membranes then became thinner and possessed a much larger electrical conductance. The EIS allowed a distinction to be made between a hydrophobic region in the center of the bilayer and another hydrophobic region further out towards the polar head region, in addition to the polar head region itself.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm.

In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79.

In addition, new questions arose from recent TR-SWAXS data that were interpreted as underdamped oscillations of an entire protein, thus challenging the long-standing concept of overdamped global protein dynamics. Based on molecular-dynamics simulations, we present a detailed molecular movie of the protein quake after carbon monoxide (CO) photodissociation in myoglobin. The simulations suggest that the protein quake is characterized by a single pressure peak that propagates anisotropically within 500 fs across the protein and further into the solvent. By computing TR-SWAXS patterns from the simulations, we could interpret features in the reciprocal-space SWAXS signals as specific real-space dynamics, such as CO displacement and pressure wave propagation. Remarkably, we found that the small-angle data primarily detect modulations of the solvent density but not oscillations of the bare protein, thereby reconciling recent TR-SWAXS experiments with the notion of overdamped global protein dynamics"}, {"phrase": "polar Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations", "id": "932", "article": "An increasing number of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crystal structures provide important-albeit static-pictures of how small molecules or peptides interact with their receptors.

We find good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of ligand concentrations, accounting for equilibrium channel properties, transient responses to changing ligand conditions, and modal gating statistics. We show how this can be understood within a simple analytical framework and confirm our results with stochastic simulations. The model assumes that channel subunits are independent, demonstrating that cooperative binding or concerted conformational changes are not required for modal gating.

To discover the cleavage mechanism, it is urgent to predict the structures of APP monomers and dimers in varying membrane environments. We determined the structures of the C9923-55 monomer and homodimer as a function of membrane lipid composition using a multiscale simulation approach that blends atomistic and coarse-grained models. We demonstrate that the C9923-55 homodimer structures form a heterogeneous ensemble with multiple conformational states, each stabilized by characteristic interpeptide interactions. The relative probabilities of each conformational state are sensitive to the membrane environment, leading to substantial variation in homodimer peptide structure as a function of membrane lipid composition or the presence of an anionic lipid environment. In contrast, the helicity of the transmembrane domain of monomeric C991-55 is relatively insensitive to the membrane lipid composition, in agreement with experimental observations. The dimer structures of human EphA2 receptor depend on the lipid environment, which we show is linked to the location of the structural motifs in the dimer interface, thereby establishing that both sequence and membrane composition modulate the complete energy landscape of membrane-bound proteins. As a by-product of our work, we explain the discrepancy in structures predicted for C99 congener homodimers in membrane and micelle environments.

This parcellation was then used as a basis for analyzing the receptor expression for 15 receptor types. Receptor fingerprints, i.e., the characteristic balance between densities of all receptor types, were generated in each subdivision to comprehensively visualize differences and similarities in receptor architecture between the subdivisions.

We propose a versatile approach to directing placement of colloids using nematic liquid crystals with spatially varying molecular orientation preimposed by substrate photoalignment. Colloidal particles in a nematic environment are subject to the long-range elastic forces originating in the orientational order of the nematic. Gradients of the orientational order create an elastic energy landscape that drives the colloids into locations with preferred type of deformations. As an example, we demonstrate that colloidal spheres with perpendicular surface anchoring are driven into the regions of maximum splay, whereas spheres with tangential surface anchoring settle into the regions of bend. Elastic forces responsible for preferential placement are measured by exploring overdamped dynamics of the colloids.

A long-standing challenge for piezoelectric materials has been to understand how these ultrahigh electromechanical responses occur when the polar atomic displacements underlying the response are partially broken into polar nanoregions (PNRs) in relaxor-based ferroelectrics. Given the complex inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions. By using neutron scattering measurements of lattice dynamics and local structure, we show that the vibrational modes of the PNRs enable giant coupling by softening the underlying macrodomain polarization rotations in relaxor-based ferroelectric PMN-xPT {(1 - x)[Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3] - xPbTiO3} (x = 30%). The mechanism involves the collective motion of the PNRs with transverse acoustic phonons and results in two hybrid modes, one softer and one stiffer than the bare acoustic phonon. The softer mode is the origin of macroscopic shear softening. Furthermore, a PNR mode and a component of the local structure align in an electric field; this further enhances shear softening, revealing a way to tune the ultrahigh piezoelectric response by engineering elastic shear softening"}, {"phrase": "polar Cytochrome", "id": "12166", "article": "In total, 210 paired measurements were compared.

These tethered bilayer lipid membranes tBLM were formed on a commercially available chemically modified gold substrate. These lipid bilayers are very robust. Very high-resolution electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the dielectric structure of the lipid bilayers and associated interfaces. The EIS data allowed the dielectric substructure of the lipid bilayers to be determined.

However, only a minute volume of ISF could be transdermally extracted, which is required to be diluted to form a manipulable volume of fluid for easy collection, transportation, and glucose detection. Therefore, a high-resolution glucose detection method is required for detecting glucose concentration in diluted ISF. In this paper, an optical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor modified by the glucose/galactose-binding (GGB) protein which has good affinity to glucose molecules was presented for specific and sensitive glucose detection. The GGB protein was mutated at different sites for thiol coupling with the SPR surface and adjusting the affinity between glucose molecules and GGB protein. And the immobilization process of the GGB protein onto the surface of SPR sensor was optimized. Then, the stability of the SPR sensor modified with GGB protein was tested immediately and two weeks after immobilization. The coefficient of variation for glucose concentration measurement was less than 4.5%. By further mutation of the GGB protein at the A213S and L238S sites, the measurement range of the SPR sensor was adjusted to 0.1-100 mg/dL, which matches the glucose concentration range of 5-10 times diluted ISF (3-100 mg/dL).

While heart-beat-based security holds promise in mobile health (mHealth) applications, there currently exists no work that provides a detailed characterization of the delivered security in a real system. In this paper, we evaluate the strength of IPI-based security keys in the context of entity authentication. We investigate several aspects that should be considered in practice, including subjects with reduced heart-rate variability (HRV), different sensor-sampling frequencies, intersensor variability (i.e., how accurate each entity may measure heart beats) as well as average and worst-case-authentication time. Contrary to the current state of the art, our evaluation demonstrates that authentication using multiple, less-entropic keys may actually increase the key strength by reducing the effects of intersensor variability. Moreover, we find that the maximal key strength of a 60-bit key varies between 29.2 bits and only 5.7 bits, depending on the subject's HRV. To improve security, we introduce the inter-multi-pulse interval (ImPI), a novel method of extracting entropy from the heart by considering the time difference between nonconsecutive heart beats. Given the same authentication time, using the ImPI for key generation increases key strength by up to 3.4 \u00c3\u0097 (+19.2 bits) for subjects with limited HRV, at the cost of an extended key-generation time of 4.8 \u00c3\u0097 (+45 s)"}, {"phrase": "sensor characterization", "id": "15922", "article": "The quantitative assembly and disassembly of a new type of dynamic covalent nanoparticle (NP) building block is reported.

In this study, the iFEM-RZT algorithm is implemented by utilizing a novel three-node C\u00c2\u00b0-continuous inverse-shell element, known as i3-RZT. The discrete strain data is generated numerically through performing a high-fidelity finite element analysis on the wing-shaped panel. This numerical strain data represents experimental strain readings obtained from surface patched strain gauges or embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Three different sensor placement configurations with varying density and alignment of strain data were examined and their corresponding displacement contours were compared with those of reference solutions. The results indicate that a sparse distribution of FBG sensors (uniaxial strain measurements), aligned in only the longitudinal direction, is sufficient for predicting accurate full-field membrane and bending responses (deformed shapes) of the panel, including a true zigzag representation of interfacial displacements. On the other hand, a sparse deployment of strain rosettes (triaxial strain measurements) is essentially enough to produce torsion shapes that are as accurate as those of predicted by a dense sensor placement configuration.

The use of these numbering schemes has facilitated many chemogenomics studies such as consensus binding site definition, binding site comparison, ligand repurposing (e.g. for orphan receptors), sequence-based pharmacophore generation for homology modeling or virtual screening, and class-wide chemogenomics studies of GPCRs"}, {"phrase": "sensor Binding Site", "id": "12138", "article": "A number of drugs influenced the accuracy of the LiDCO sensor in vitro but, based on published pharmacokinetic data, only xylazine, ketamine, lidocaine, and rocuronium may cause biases at clinically relevant concentrations.

However, questions remain regarding the role of loop motion in TCR binding, and crystallographic structures have raised questions about the extent to which generalizations can be made. Here we studied the flexibility of two structurally well characterized \u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00b2 TCRs, A6 and DMF5. We found that the two receptors utilize loop motion very differently in ligand binding and cross-reactivity. While the loops of A6 move rapidly in an uncorrelated fashion, those of DMF5 are substantially less mobile. Accordingly, the mechanisms of binding and cross-reactivity are very different between the two TCRs: whereas A6 relies on conformational selection to select and bind different ligands, DMF5 uses a more rigid, permissive architecture with greater reliance on slower motions or induced-fit. In addition to binding site flexibility, we also explored whether ligand-binding resulted in common dynamical changes in A6 and DMF5 that could contribute to TCR triggering. Although binding-linked motional changes propagated throughout both receptors, no common features were observed, suggesting that changes in nanosecond-level TCR structural dynamics do not contribute to T cell signaling"}, {"phrase": "sensor Binding Site", "id": "12880", "article": "Five healthy adult warm-blood horses were injected with 0.5 mg kg(-1) xylazine i.v.

This is a basic yet unanswered question regarding the olfactory system. The olfactory system of Drosophila has a repertoire of approximately 60 odorant receptors. Molecules bind to odorant receptors with different affinities and activate them with different efficacies, thus providing a combinatorial code that identifies odorants. We hypothesized that the binding affinity of an odorant-receptor pair is affected by their relative sizes. The maximum affinity can be attained when the molecular volume of an odorant matches the volume of the binding pocket. The affinity drops to zero when the sizes are too different, thus obscuring the effects of other molecular properties. We developed a mathematical formulation of this hypothesis and verified it using Drosophila data. We also predicted the volume and structural flexibility of the binding site of each odorant receptor; these features significantly differ between odorant receptors.

A single amino acid substitution at this position (P130Q) in the variant OXA-109 greatly enhances the mobility of both I129 and a key active-site tryptophan (W222), thereby facilitating carbapenem binding.

Persistence probability was near 0 for the FMDV-like case under a wide range of parameter values and contact structures, while persistence was probable for the CSFV-like case. There were no sets of conditions where the FMDV-like pathogen persisted in every stochastic simulation. Even when population growth rates were up to 300% annually, the FMDV-like pathogen persisted in <25% of simulations regardless of transmission probabilities and contact structure. For networks and spatial contact structure, persistence probability of the FMDV-like pathogen was always <10%. Because of its low persistence probability, even very early response to the FMDV-like pathogen in feral swine was unwarranted while response to the CSFV-like pathogen was generally effective.

To discover the cleavage mechanism, it is urgent to predict the structures of APP monomers and dimers in varying membrane environments. We determined the structures of the C9923-55 monomer and homodimer as a function of membrane lipid composition using a multiscale simulation approach that blends atomistic and coarse-grained models. We demonstrate that the C9923-55 homodimer structures form a heterogeneous ensemble with multiple conformational states, each stabilized by characteristic interpeptide interactions. The relative probabilities of each conformational state are sensitive to the membrane environment, leading to substantial variation in homodimer peptide structure as a function of membrane lipid composition or the presence of an anionic lipid environment. In contrast, the helicity of the transmembrane domain of monomeric C991-55 is relatively insensitive to the membrane lipid composition, in agreement with experimental observations. The dimer structures of human EphA2 receptor depend on the lipid environment, which we show is linked to the location of the structural motifs in the dimer interface, thereby establishing that both sequence and membrane composition modulate the complete energy landscape of membrane-bound proteins. As a by-product of our work, we explain the discrepancy in structures predicted for C99 congener homodimers in membrane and micelle environments.

For sustained synaptic transmission, synaptic vesicles (SVs) are required to be recycled and refilled with neurotransmitters using an H(+) electrochemical gradient. However, neither the mechanism underlying vesicular GABA uptake nor the kinetics of GABA loading in living neurons have been fully elucidated. To characterize the process of GABA uptake into SVs in functional synapses, we monitored luminal pH of GABAergic SVs separately from that of excitatory glutamatergic SVs in cultured hippocampal neurons. By using a pH sensor optimal for the SV lumen, we found that GABAergic SVs exhibited an unexpectedly higher resting pH (\u00e2\u0088\u00bc6.4) than glutamatergic SVs (pH \u00e2\u0088\u00bc5.8). Moreover, unlike glutamatergic SVs, GABAergic SVs displayed unique pH dynamics after endocytosis that involved initial overacidification and subsequent alkalization that restored their resting pH.

Comparison of luminal pH dynamics in the presence or absence of VGAT showed that VGAT operates as a GABA/H(+) exchanger, which is continuously required to offset GABA leakage.

In this study, the iFEM-RZT algorithm is implemented by utilizing a novel three-node C\u00c2\u00b0-continuous inverse-shell element, known as i3-RZT. The discrete strain data is generated numerically through performing a high-fidelity finite element analysis on the wing-shaped panel.

Three different sensor placement configurations with varying density and alignment of strain data were examined and their corresponding displacement contours were compared with those of reference solutions. The results indicate that a sparse distribution of FBG sensors (uniaxial strain measurements), aligned in only the longitudinal direction, is sufficient for predicting accurate full-field membrane and bending responses (deformed shapes) of the panel, including a true zigzag representation of interfacial displacements. On the other hand, a sparse deployment of strain rosettes (triaxial strain measurements) is essentially enough to produce torsion shapes that are as accurate as those of predicted by a dense sensor placement configuration.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm.

In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82.

At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-.

Accordingly, the mechanisms of binding and cross-reactivity are very different between the two TCRs: whereas A6 relies on conformational selection to select and bind different ligands, DMF5 uses a more rigid, permissive architecture with greater reliance on slower motions or induced-fit. In addition to binding site flexibility, we also explored whether ligand-binding resulted in common dynamical changes in A6 and DMF5 that could contribute to TCR triggering. Although binding-linked motional changes propagated throughout both receptors, no common features were observed, suggesting that changes in nanosecond-level TCR structural dynamics do not contribute to T cell signaling"}, {"phrase": "characterization Binding Site", "id": "930", "article": "There is a substantial amount of historical ligand binding data available from site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) studies of many different GPCR subtypes.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity.

The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface.

In the simulations at moderate Bjerrum length, we observe that the brush height varies weakly with grafting density, in contrast to the accepted scaling law, which predicts a brush thickness independent of the grafting density. We show that such behavior can be explained by considering lateral electrostatic effects (within the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory) combined with the coupling between lateral and longitudinal degrees of freedom due to the conserved polymer volume (which are neglected in scaling arguments). We also take the non-linear elasticity of polyelectrolyte chains into consideration, which makes significant effects as chains are almost fully stretched in the osmotic regime. It is shown that all these factors lead to a non-monotonic behavior for the brush height as a function of the grafting density. At large grafting densities, the brush height increases with increasing the grafting density due to the volume constraint. At small grafting densities, we obtain a re-stretching of the chains for decreasing grafting density, which is caused by lateral electrostatic contributions and is controlled by the counterion-condensation process around polyelectrolyte chains. These results are obtained assuming all counterions to be trapped within the brush, which is valid for sufficiently long chains of large charge fraction"}, {"phrase": "characterization Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations", "id": "975", "article": "This work focuses on the chemical characterization of fine aerosol particles (P"}, {"phrase": "characterization Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations", "id": "14952", "article": "Registration of an in vivo microscopy image sequence is necessary in many significant studies, including studies of atherosclerosis in large arteries and the heart. Significant cardiac and respiratory motion of the living subject, occasional spells of focal plane changes, drift in the field of view, and long image sequences are the principal roadblocks. The first step in such a registration process is the removal of translational and rotational motion. Next, a deformable registration can be performed. The focus of our study here is to remove the translation and/or rigid body motion that we refer to here as coarse alignment. The existing techniques for coarse alignment are unable to accommodate long sequences often consisting of periods of poor quality images (as quantified by a suitable perceptual measure). Many existing methods require the user to select an anchor image to which other images are registered. We propose a novel method for coarse image sequence alignment based on minimum weighted spanning trees (MISTICA) that overcomes these difficulties. The principal idea behind MISTICA is to reorder the images in shorter sequences, to demote nonconforming or poor quality images in the registration process, and to mitigate the error propagation. The anchor image is selected automatically making MISTICA completely automated. MISTICA is computationally efficient. It has a single tuning parameter that determines graph width, which can also be eliminated by the way of additional computation.

Persistence probability was near 0 for the FMDV-like case under a wide range of parameter values and contact structures, while persistence was probable for the CSFV-like case.

Because of its low persistence probability, even very early response to the FMDV-like pathogen in feral swine was unwarranted while response to the CSFV-like pathogen was generally effective.

To discover the cleavage mechanism, it is urgent to predict the structures of APP monomers and dimers in varying membrane environments. We determined the structures of the C9923-55 monomer and homodimer as a function of membrane lipid composition using a multiscale simulation approach that blends atomistic and coarse-grained models. We demonstrate that the C9923-55 homodimer structures form a heterogeneous ensemble with multiple conformational states, each stabilized by characteristic interpeptide interactions. The relative probabilities of each conformational state are sensitive to the membrane environment, leading to substantial variation in homodimer peptide structure as a function of membrane lipid composition or the presence of an anionic lipid environment. In contrast, the helicity of the transmembrane domain of monomeric C991-55 is relatively insensitive to the membrane lipid composition, in agreement with experimental observations. The dimer structures of human EphA2 receptor depend on the lipid environment, which we show is linked to the location of the structural motifs in the dimer interface, thereby establishing that both sequence and membrane composition modulate the complete energy landscape of membrane-bound proteins.

In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules.

We hypothesized that the binding affinity of an odorant-receptor pair is affected by their relative sizes. The maximum affinity can be attained when the molecular volume of an odorant matches the volume of the binding pocket. The affinity drops to zero when the sizes are too different, thus obscuring the effects of other molecular properties.

Many of the molecular mechanisms associated with transient spine enlargement have been identified experimentally. Here, we use a systems biology approach to construct a mathematical model of biochemical signaling and actin-mediated transient spine expansion in response to calcium influx caused by NMDA receptor activation. We have identified that a key feature of this signaling network is the paradoxical signaling loop. Paradoxical components act bifunctionally in signaling networks, and their role is to control both the activation and the inhibition of a desired response function (protein activity or spine volume). Using ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modeling, we show that the dynamics of different regulators of transient spine expansion, including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), RhoA, and Cdc42, and the spine volume can be described using paradoxical signaling loops.

In the simulations at moderate Bjerrum length, we observe that the brush height varies weakly with grafting density, in contrast to the accepted scaling law, which predicts a brush thickness independent of the grafting density. We show that such behavior can be explained by considering lateral electrostatic effects (within the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory) combined with the coupling between lateral and longitudinal degrees of freedom due to the conserved polymer volume (which are neglected in scaling arguments). We also take the non-linear elasticity of polyelectrolyte chains into consideration, which makes significant effects as chains are almost fully stretched in the osmotic regime. It is shown that all these factors lead to a non-monotonic behavior for the brush height as a function of the grafting density. At large grafting densities, the brush height increases with increasing the grafting density due to the volume constraint. At small grafting densities, we obtain a re-stretching of the chains for decreasing grafting density, which is caused by lateral electrostatic contributions and is controlled by the counterion-condensation process around polyelectrolyte chains. These results are obtained assuming all counterions to be trapped within the brush, which is valid for sufficiently long chains of large charge fraction"}, {"phrase": "Aromatic Residue Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations", "id": "14952", "article": "Registration of an in vivo microscopy image sequence is necessary in many significant studies, including studies of atherosclerosis in large arteries and the heart. Significant cardiac and respiratory motion of the living subject, occasional spells of focal plane changes, drift in the field of view, and long image sequences are the principal roadblocks. The first step in such a registration process is the removal of translational and rotational motion. Next, a deformable registration can be performed. The focus of our study here is to remove the translation and/or rigid body motion that we refer to here as coarse alignment. The existing techniques for coarse alignment are unable to accommodate long sequences often consisting of periods of poor quality images (as quantified by a suitable perceptual measure). Many existing methods require the user to select an anchor image to which other images are registered. We propose a novel method for coarse image sequence alignment based on minimum weighted spanning trees (MISTICA) that overcomes these difficulties. The principal idea behind MISTICA is to reorder the images in shorter sequences, to demote nonconforming or poor quality images in the registration process, and to mitigate the error propagation. The anchor image is selected automatically making MISTICA completely automated. MISTICA is computationally efficient.

We determined the structures of the C9923-55 monomer and homodimer as a function of membrane lipid composition using a multiscale simulation approach that blends atomistic and coarse-grained models. We demonstrate that the C9923-55 homodimer structures form a heterogeneous ensemble with multiple conformational states, each stabilized by characteristic interpeptide interactions. The relative probabilities of each conformational state are sensitive to the membrane environment, leading to substantial variation in homodimer peptide structure as a function of membrane lipid composition or the presence of an anionic lipid environment. In contrast, the helicity of the transmembrane domain of monomeric C991-55 is relatively insensitive to the membrane lipid composition, in agreement with experimental observations.

Despite this, few CYP450s have been functionally characterized in model plants and roles of fewer CYP450s are known in non-model, medicinal, and aromatic plants. Our study in Coleus forskohlii indicates that flavone synthase (CYP93B) and flavonoid 3' monooxygenase (CYP706C) are key enzymes positioned at a metabolic junction, to execute the biosynthesis of different sub-classes of flavonoids (flavones, flavonol, anthocynanin, isoflavones etc.) from a common precursor. Such branch points are favored targets for artificially modulating the metabolic flux toward specific metabolites, through genetic manipulation or use of elicitors that differentially impact the expression of branch point genes. Genkwanin, the only flavone reported from C. forskohlii, is known to possess anti-inflammatory activity. It is biosynthesized from the general flavonoid precursor: naringenin. Two differentially expressed cytochrome P450 genes (CfCYP93B, CfCYP706C), exhibiting maximum expression in leaf tissues, were isolated from C. forskohlii. Mannitol treatment resulted in increased expression of CfCYP93B and decrease in expression of CfCYP706C. Metabolite quantification data showed that genkwanin content increased and anthocyanin levels decreased in response to mannitol treatment. Alignment, phylogenetic analysis, modeling, and molecular docking analysis of protein sequences suggested that CfCYP93B may be involved in conversion of naringenin to flavones (possibly genkwanin via apigenin), while CfCYP706C may act on common precursors of flavonoid metabolism and channel the substrate toward production of flavonols or anthocynanins. Decrease in expression of CfCYP706C and increase in accumulation of genkwanin suggested that mannitol treatment may possibly lead to accumulation of genkwanin via suppression of a competitive branch of flavonoids in C. forskohlii."}, {"phrase": "Aromatic Residue Cytochrome", "id": "17525", "article": "Copper-catalyzed decarboxylative thiolation using molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant was developed.

However, the underlying biophysical mechanisms that give rise to modal gating in this and most other channels remain unknown. Although ion channels are composed of protein subunits, previous mathematical models of modal gating are coarse grained at the level of whole-channel states, limiting further dialogue between theory and experiment.

We find good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of ligand concentrations, accounting for equilibrium channel properties, transient responses to changing ligand conditions, and modal gating statistics. We show how this can be understood within a simple analytical framework and confirm our results with stochastic simulations. The model assumes that channel subunits are independent, demonstrating that cooperative binding or concerted conformational changes are not required for modal gating.

This study aims to determine whether maslinic acid interacts with hGIIA-sPLA2 and inhibits inflammatory response induced by this enzyme. It is shown that maslinic acid enhanced intrinsic fluorescence of hGIIA-sPLA2 and inhibited its enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Molecular docking revealed that maslinic acid binds to calcium binding and interfacial phospholipid binding site, suggesting that it inhibit access of catalytic calcium ion for enzymatic reaction and block binding of the enzyme to membrane phospholipid. The hGIIA-sPLA2 enzyme is also responsible in mediating monocyte recruitment and differentiation. Results showed that maslinic acid inhibit hGIIA-sPLA2-induced THP-1 cell differentiation and migration, and the effect observed is specific to hGIIA-sPLA2 as cells treated with maslinic acid alone did not significantly affect the number of adherent and migrated cells. Considering that hGIIA-sPLA2 enzyme is known to hydrolyze glyceroacylphospholipids present in lipoproteins and cell membranes, maslinic acid may bind and inhibit hGIIA-sPLA2 enzymatic activity, thereby reduces the release of fatty acids and lysophospholipids which stimulates monocyte migration and differentiation.

The interpretations of FRET experiments with standard F\u00c3\u00b6rster theory relies on the following approximations: (i) a point-dipole approximation (PDA) for the coupling between transition densities of the chromophores, (ii) a screening of this coupling by the inverse optical dielectric constant of the medium, and (iii) the assumption of a fast isotropic sampling over the mutual orientations of the chromophores. These approximations become critical in particular at short intermolecular distances, where the PDA and the screening model become invalid and the variation of interchromophore distances and not just orientations have a critical influence on the excitation energy transfer. Here we present a quantum chemical/electrostatic/molecular dynamics method that goes beyond all of the above approximations.

In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule"}, {"phrase": "Binding Site Cytochrome", "id": "23", "article": "Structural basis of drug binding to CYP46A1, an enzyme that controls cholesterol turnover in the brain Cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1) initiates the major pathway of cholesterol elimination from the brain and thereby controls cholesterol turnover in this organ.

We hypothesized that the binding affinity of an odorant-receptor pair is affected by their relative sizes.

Many of the molecular mechanisms associated with transient spine enlargement have been identified experimentally. Here, we use a systems biology approach to construct a mathematical model of biochemical signaling and actin-mediated transient spine expansion in response to calcium influx caused by NMDA receptor activation. We have identified that a key feature of this signaling network is the paradoxical signaling loop. Paradoxical components act bifunctionally in signaling networks, and their role is to control both the activation and the inhibition of a desired response function (protein activity or spine volume). Using ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modeling, we show that the dynamics of different regulators of transient spine expansion, including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), RhoA, and Cdc42, and the spine volume can be described using paradoxical signaling loops. Our model is able to capture the experimentally observed dynamics of transient spine volume. Furthermore, we show that actin remodeling events provide a robustness to spine volume dynamics.

In the simulations at moderate Bjerrum length, we observe that the brush height varies weakly with grafting density, in contrast to the accepted scaling law, which predicts a brush thickness independent of the grafting density. We show that such behavior can be explained by considering lateral electrostatic effects (within the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory) combined with the coupling between lateral and longitudinal degrees of freedom due to the conserved polymer volume (which are neglected in scaling arguments). We also take the non-linear elasticity of polyelectrolyte chains into consideration, which makes significant effects as chains are almost fully stretched in the osmotic regime. It is shown that all these factors lead to a non-monotonic behavior for the brush height as a function of the grafting density. At large grafting densities, the brush height increases with increasing the grafting density due to the volume constraint. At small grafting densities, we obtain a re-stretching of the chains for decreasing grafting density, which is caused by lateral electrostatic contributions and is controlled by the counterion-condensation process around polyelectrolyte chains. These results are obtained assuming all counterions to be trapped within the brush, which is valid for sufficiently long chains of large charge fraction"}, {"phrase": "Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations Cytochrome", "id": "14952", "article": "Registration of an in vivo microscopy image sequence is necessary in many significant studies, including studies of atherosclerosis in large arteries and the heart. Significant cardiac and respiratory motion of the living subject, occasional spells of focal plane changes, drift in the field of view, and long image sequences are the principal roadblocks. The first step in such a registration process is the removal of translational and rotational motion. Next, a deformable registration can be performed. The focus of our study here is to remove the translation and/or rigid body motion that we refer to here as coarse alignment. The existing techniques for coarse alignment are unable to accommodate long sequences often consisting of periods of poor quality images (as quantified by a suitable perceptual measure). Many existing methods require the user to select an anchor image to which other images are registered. We propose a novel method for coarse image sequence alignment based on minimum weighted spanning trees (MISTICA) that overcomes these difficulties. The principal idea behind MISTICA is to reorder the images in shorter sequences, to demote nonconforming or poor quality images in the registration process, and to mitigate the error propagation. The anchor image is selected automatically making MISTICA completely automated. MISTICA is computationally efficient. It has a single tuning parameter that determines graph width, which can also be eliminated by the way of additional computation.

We determined the structures of the C9923-55 monomer and homodimer as a function of membrane lipid composition using a multiscale simulation approach that blends atomistic and coarse-grained models. We demonstrate that the C9923-55 homodimer structures form a heterogeneous ensemble with multiple conformational states, each stabilized by characteristic interpeptide interactions. The relative probabilities of each conformational state are sensitive to the membrane environment, leading to substantial variation in homodimer peptide structure as a function of membrane lipid composition or the presence of an anionic lipid environment. In contrast, the helicity of the transmembrane domain of monomeric C991-55 is relatively insensitive to the membrane lipid composition, in agreement with experimental observations.
