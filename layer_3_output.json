CyaA is activated by calmodulin (CaM) and compromises host defense by excessive cAMP production. Hence, pharmacological modulation of the CyaA/CaM interaction could constitute a promising approach to treat whooping cough, provided that interactions of endogenous effector proteins with CaM are not affected. As a first step toward this ambitious goal we examined the interactions of CyaA with wild-type CaM and four CaM mutants in which most methionine residues were replaced by leucine residues and studied the effects of the CaM antagonists calmidazolium, trifluoperazine and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7). CyaA/CaM interaction was monitored by CaM-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between tryptophan residues in CyaA and 2'-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-3'-deoxy-adenosine 5'-triphosphate and catalytic activity. Comparison of the concentration/response curves of CaM and CaM mutants for FRET and catalysis revealed differences, suggesting a two-step activation mechanism of CyaA by CaM. Even in the absence of CaM, calmidazolium inhibited catalysis, and it did so according to a biphasic function. Trifluoperazine and W-7 did not inhibit FRET or catalysis. In contrast to CyaA, some CaM mutants were more efficacious than CaM at activating membranous AC isoform 1. The slope of CyaA activation by CaM was much steeper than of AC1 activation. Collectively, the two-step activation mechanism of CyaA by CaM offers opportunities for pharmacological intervention.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue.

A unique member of this family, Nox1 oxidase, functions as either a canonical or hybrid system using Nox organizing subunit 1 (NoxO1) or p47(phox), respectively, the latter of which is functional in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In this manuscript, we identify critical requirement of ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50; aka NHERF1) for Nox1 activation and downstream responses. Superoxide (O2 (\u00e2\u0080\u00a2-)) production induced by angiotensin II (AngII) was absent in mouse EBP50 KO VSMC vs. WT.

Similarly, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative stress was attenuated in femoral arteries from EBP50 KO vs. WT.

Finally, ex vivo measurement of lumen diameter in mouse resistance arteries exhibited attenuated AngII-induced vasoconstriction in EBP50 KO vs. WT. Taken together, our data identify EBP50 as a previously unidentified regulator of Nox1 and support that it promotes Nox1 activity by binding p47(phox) This interaction is pivotal for agonist-induced smooth muscle ROS, hypertrophy, and vasoconstriction and has implications for ROS-mediated physiological and pathophysiological processes"}, {"phrase": "Mutants NOX", "id": "143", "article": "We find that IAV-infected zebrafish display mild muscle degeneration with sarcolemma damage and compromised ECM adhesion.

Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

All the mutants are tetrameric and T-state in the deoxygenated derivative. Reassociation of deoxygenated dimers is not modified by interface mutations. DeoxyHb alpha T38W/beta W37T dissociate much faster. We propose a binding site for I- at the switch region.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described.

The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect.

Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation.

Given the complex inhomogeneous nanostructure of these materials, it has generally been assumed that this enhanced response must involve complicated interactions.

In all Na(+)-dependent transporters with the same fold as NIS, the side chains of two residues, S353 and T354 (NIS numbering), were identified as the Na(+) ligands at Na2. To understand the cooperativity between the substrates, we investigated the coordination at the Na2 site. We determined that four other residues-S66, D191, Q194, and Q263-are also involved in Na(+) coordination at this site. Experiments in whole cells demonstrated that these four residues participate in transport by NIS: mutations at these positions result in proteins that, although expressed at the plasma membrane, transport little or no I(-) These residues are conserved throughout the entire SLC5 family, to which NIS belongs, suggesting that they serve a similar function in the other transporters.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm.

The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect.

In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family"}, {"phrase": "sensor Binding Site", "id": "19", "article": "Structural insights into the role of iron-histidine bond cleavage in nitric oxide-induced activation of H-NOX gas sensor proteins Heme-nitric oxide/oxygen (H-NOX) binding domains are a recently discovered family of heme-based gas sensor proteins that are conserved across eukaryotes and bacteria. Nitric oxide (NO) binding to the heme cofactor of H-NOX proteins has been implicated as a regulatory mechanism for processes ranging from vasodilation in mammals to communal behavior in bacteria. A key molecular event during NO-dependent activation of H-NOX proteins is rupture of the heme-histidine bond and formation of a five-coordinate nitrosyl complex. Although extensive biochemical studies have provided insight into the NO activation mechanism, precise molecular-level details have remained elusive. In the present study, high-resolution crystal structures of the H-NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis in the unligated, intermediate six-coordinate and activated five-coordinate, NO-bound states are reported. From these structures, it is evident that several structural features in the heme pocket of the unligated protein function to maintain the heme distorted from planarity. NO-induced scission of the iron-histidine bond triggers structural rearrangements in the heme pocket that permit the heme to relax toward planarity, yielding the signaling-competent NO-bound conformation. Here, we also provide characterization of a nonheme metal coordination site occupied by zinc in an H-NOX protein."}, {"phrase": "sensor Binding Site", "id": "3421", "article": "Site I inactivation of calmodulin (CaM) was used to examine the importance of aspartic acid 22 at position 3 in CaM calcium binding, protein folding, and activation of the"}, {"phrase": "sensor Binding Site", "id": "10", "article": "Chloride ion independence of the Bohr effect in a mutant human hemoglobin beta (V1M+H2deleted) A mutant human hemoglobin, beta (V1M+H2 delta), has been constructed. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule"}, {"phrase": "sensor Binding Site", "id": "10736", "article": "Significant increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) may occur during neuroendoscopic procedures.

We also discuss considerations for choosing TAL effector/mDBD or alternative nuclease technologies for genome engineering projects ranging from basic laboratory gene editing of cultured cell lines to therapeutics. Finally, we highlight how the rapid pace of development of mDBD-based, such as monomeric TALENs (I-TevI-TAL), and more recently RNA-guided nucleases (CRISPR-Cas9) has led to a transition in the field of genome engineering towards development of the next generation of technologies aimed at controlling events that occur after targeted DNA breaks are made."}]
